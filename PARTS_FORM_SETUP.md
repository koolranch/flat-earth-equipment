# Parts Request Form - Email-Only Setup

## How It Works

The parts request form on brand serial lookup pages uses **the same email system as your certification emails** (Resend)‚Äîsimple, reliable, no database needed.

### Flow:
1. User fills out form on `/brand/{brand}/serial-lookup`
2. Form POSTs to `/api/leads/parts`
3. API sends **two emails** via Resend (same as cert emails):
   - One to you (sales notification)
   - One to customer (auto-reply confirmation)
4. Returns success ‚úÖ

**Same email service you already use. No additional setup if Resend is already configured!**

## ‚úÖ What You Need

### Required Environment Variables

These should **already be set** if your certification emails work:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"           # Same key used for cert emails
LEADS_TO_EMAIL="sales@flatearthequipment.com"  # Where you receive parts notifications
```

### Optional:
```bash
EMAIL_FROM="Flat Earth Equipment <parts@flatearthequipment.com>"  # Defaults to no-reply if not set
```

## üîç Check If Already Configured

If your **certification emails work**, you already have `RESEND_API_KEY` set in Vercel.

You just need to add `LEADS_TO_EMAIL`:

1. Go to: Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Check if `RESEND_API_KEY` exists ‚úÖ (should already be there)
3. Add `LEADS_TO_EMAIL` with your sales email address

## üìß Emails Sent

## üß™ Testing

1. **Check environment variables are set:**
   - Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` ‚úÖ (should already exist for cert emails)
   - `LEADS_TO_EMAIL` ‚Üê **Add this if not set**

2. **Redeploy** (if you just added `LEADS_TO_EMAIL`):
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger redeploy"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Test the form:**
   - Visit: https://flatearthequipment.com/brand/takeuchi/serial-lookup
   - Fill out the form with your email
   - Submit
   - Check your inbox for both emails (should look like cert emails)

## üõ°Ô∏è Spam Protection

The form includes:
- ‚úÖ **Honeypot field** (hidden "Company" field catches bots)
- ‚úÖ **Dwell-time check** (submissions < 3 seconds rejected)
- ‚úÖ **Email validation** (frontend + backend)
- ‚úÖ **Required fields** (email, parts description)

Bots get silently accepted (return 200) but no email is sent.

## üéØ Why Email-Only?

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Simple‚Äîno database migration needed
- ‚úÖ Works immediately with just env vars
- ‚úÖ You get notified in your inbox
- ‚úÖ Customer gets confirmation
- ‚úÖ No additional infrastructure

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå No historical record in dashboard
- ‚ùå No lead tracking/analytics
- ‚ùå Can't build CRM features
- ‚ùå If email fails, lead is lost

**For most use cases, email-only is perfectly fine.** If you later want to track leads in a database, we can add that as an optional enhancement.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Form shows error message

**"Failed to send email"**
‚Üí Check that `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Vercel
‚Üí Verify `LEADS_TO_EMAIL` is a valid email address
‚Üí Check Resend dashboard for delivery errors

### Form submits but no emails received

1. **Check Vercel logs:**
   - Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Latest ‚Üí Functions
   - Look for `/api/leads/parts` logs
   - Check for email send errors

2. **Check Resend dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://resend.com/emails
   - See if emails were sent/delivered
   - Check for bounce/rejection messages

3. **Check spam folder:**
   - Parts request emails might be filtered
   - Look for subject: "Parts Lead ‚Äî {brand}"

### Form submits instantly (suspicious)

This is normal‚Äîbots that fill the form too fast are silently rejected. Real users take at least 3 seconds to fill the form.

## ‚úÖ Current Status

- [x] API uses Resend (same as certification emails)
- [x] Email-only (no database needed)
- [x] Honeypot and anti-spam measures in place
- [x] Professional HTML email templates
- [ ] **TODO:** Add LEADS_TO_EMAIL to Vercel env vars
- [ ] **TODO:** Test form after deployment

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Add `LEADS_TO_EMAIL`** to Vercel environment variables (if not already set)
2. **Deployment is automatic** (already triggered by the push)
3. **Test the form** on any brand page
4. **Monitor your email** for parts requests

**That's it!** Since you're already using Resend for certification emails, the parts form will work with just one additional env var (`LEADS_TO_EMAIL`). üì¨

## üéØ Benefits of Using Same Email Service

- ‚úÖ **No additional services** to configure
- ‚úÖ **Same reliability** as cert emails
- ‚úÖ **Unified email logs** in Resend dashboard
- ‚úÖ **Same deliverability** (emails won't be flagged as spam)
- ‚úÖ **Consistent branding** across all emails
- ‚úÖ **One API key** to manage
