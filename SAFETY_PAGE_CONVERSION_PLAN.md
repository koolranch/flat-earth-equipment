**Goal:** Get from 0% to 3-5% conversion
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Expected Impact:** First sales within 48 hours

## 1.1 Hero Section Overhaul

### **Current Problems:**

- ❌ No mention of speed/time commitment
- ❌ Dual CTAs create confusion

### **Changes:**

**New Headline:**
```
From: "Interactive forklift training that isn't stuck in the 90s"

```

**New CTA Buttons:**

Secondary: "Preview Module 1 Free" (outline)
```

**Authority Badges (Below CTA):**
```

✅ Valid for 3 years
✅ Accepted nationwide
```

**Expected Impact:** +2-3% conversion (clear value prop + single action)

---

## 1.2 Fix Pricing Section

### **Current Problems:**

- ❌ No context for why someone would choose each option
- ❌ Savings calculations were wrong (we fixed earlier)

### **Changes:**

**Move "Popular" Badge:**
```
From: 25-Pack
To: Single Operator

New badge text: "🔥 MOST POPULAR"
```

**Update Single Operator Card:**
```

---

## 1.3 Rewrite Value Propositions

### **Current Problems:**
- ❌ Feature-focused (Interactive, Mobile-first)
- ❌ Doesn't address job seeker pain points
- ❌ Tech-speak instead of benefits

### **Changes:**

**Replace 4 value props:**

**Old → New:**

```
"Interactive, not passive"

"⚡ Get Hired Faster"
Complete certification in under 60 minutes. Start applying 
for jobs today, not next week.
```

```
"Mobile-first"
→
"💰 Save $140-$440 vs. Classroom"
$59 online vs. $200-500 in-person training. Same OSHA 
compliance, fraction of the cost. No travel required.
```

```
"Records that matter"
→
"✅ Employer-Accepted Nationwide"
QR-verifiable certificate meets OSHA 29 CFR 1910.178. 
Accepted by employers in all 50 states.
```

```
"Bilingual (coming soon)"
→
"📱 Train Anywhere, Anytime"

at home, whenever works for you. Progress auto-saved.
```

**Expected Impact:** +1% conversion (speaks to actual needs)

## 2.2 Add Job Seeker FAQ Section

**Add these FAQs (high-intent questions):**

### **Q: Will employers accept this online certification?**
**A:** Yes. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.178 allows online training for the formal instruction component. Our training is accepted by employers nationwide. Your certificate includes QR verification for instant employer validation.

### **Q: How fast can I get my certificate?**
**A:** Most operators complete training in 45-60 minutes. Your certificate is available for immediate download upon passing the final exam. You can start applying for jobs the same day.

### **Q: Is this the same as in-person classroom training?**
**A:** Yes, for the formal instruction component. OSHA requires both classroom training AND workplace evaluation. Our online course covers the classroom portion (same content as 8-hour classes). Your employer completes a brief practical evaluation on-site using our provided form.

### **Q: What if I fail the exam?**
**A:** You can retake quizzes and the final exam as many times as needed at no additional cost. Most operators pass on the first attempt.

### **Q: Do I need any special equipment?**
**A:** No. Works on any phone, tablet, or computer with internet access. No apps to download.

### **Q: How long is the certification valid?**
**A:** 3 years. OSHA requires recertification every 3 years or when changing equipment types.

**Expected Impact:** +1-2% conversion (answers objections before they leave)
