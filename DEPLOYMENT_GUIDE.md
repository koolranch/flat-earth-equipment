## üéØ **IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **1. Feature Flag Configuration**

#### **Enable Recommendations (Recommended)**
```bash
# In your production environment (.env.local or hosting platform)
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECS_ENABLED=1
```

#### **Safe Rollout (Start Disabled)**
```bash
# Start with recommendations disabled
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECS_ENABLED=0
# Then enable after verifying deployment
```

### **2. Database Migration (Optional but Recommended)**

```bash
# Apply the database schema updates
psql -d your_production_database -f supabase/migrations/20250109_add_charger_specs.sql

# Or if using Supabase CLI
supabase db push
```

### **3. Populate Structured Data (Optional)**

```bash
# Run the data population script
bun run scripts/populate-charger-fields.ts

# Verify data quality
bun run scripts/audit-chargers.ts
```

## üîç **DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION**

### **Test the Feature Flag**

#### **1. Verify Disabled State**
```bash
# Set environment variable
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECS_ENABLED=0

# Visit: https://your-domain.com/battery-chargers
# Should see: Existing charger selector with SSR grid (no recommendations section)
```

#### **2. Verify Enabled State**
```bash
# Enable recommendations
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECS_ENABLED=1

# Visit: https://your-domain.com/battery-chargers?v=48&a=75&phase=1P
# Should see: New "Recommended Chargers" section between selector and grid
```

### **Test API Endpoint**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/recommend-chargers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"voltage":48,"amps":75,"phase":"1P","limit":3}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "GREEN4 48V 75A",
      "score": 170,
      "reasons": [
        {"label": "For your 48V battery"},
        {"label": "Charge speed fit (~75A)"},
        {"label": "Single-phase compatible"}
      ],
      "fallback": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## üéõÔ∏è **DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES**

### **Strategy 1: Safe Conservative Rollout**
1. **Deploy with feature disabled** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_RECS_ENABLED=0`)
2. **Verify existing functionality** works normally
3. **Enable for internal testing** on staging
4. **Gradual rollout** by enabling for all users
5. **Monitor performance** and user feedback

### **Strategy 2: Immediate Full Rollout**
1. **Deploy with feature enabled** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_RECS_ENABLED=1`)
2. **Monitor error rates** and API performance
3. **Ready to disable instantly** if issues arise
4. **Fallback behavior** protects user experience

### **Strategy 3: A/B Testing**
1. **Deploy infrastructure** with feature disabled
2. **Enable for subset of users** via custom logic
3. **Compare conversion rates** between experiences
4. **Roll out to all users** based on results

## üìä **MONITORING & METRICS**

### **Key Metrics to Track**

#### **Performance Metrics**
- API response time for `/api/recommend-chargers`
- Page load time impact on `/battery-chargers`
- Error rates in recommendation system
- Database query performance

#### **User Experience Metrics**
- Click-through rate on recommended chargers
- Conversion rate: recommendations ‚Üí quotes/purchases
- User engagement with "How we choose" tooltip
- Bounce rate changes on charger selector page

#### **Business Metrics**
- Quote requests from recommended chargers
- Average order value from recommendations
- Customer satisfaction with charger selection
- Reduction in support tickets about compatibility

### **Recommended Monitoring Setup**

```typescript
// Add to your analytics
gtag('event', 'recommendation_click', {
  charger_slug: item.slug,
  score: item.score,
  match_type: item.fallback ? 'closest' : 'best'
});

// Track API performance
console.log('Recommendation API:', {
  duration: Date.now() - startTime,
  results: data.items.length,
  filters: payload
});
```

---

## üîß **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **1. Recommendations Not Showing**
```bash
# Check feature flag
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_RECS_ENABLED

# Check API endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/recommend-chargers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"voltage":48,"limit":1}'
```

#### **2. API Errors**
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Feature flag disabled (`RECS_DISABLED`)
- **500 Server Error**: Database connection or Supabase issues
- **Empty Results**: No chargers match criteria (normal behavior)

#### **3. UI Not Loading**
- **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
- **Verify component imports** are correct
- **Ensure Tailwind classes** are available
- **Check TypeScript compilation** errors

#### **4. Database Issues**
```sql
-- Verify migration applied
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'parts' AND column_name LIKE 'dc_%';

-- Should return: dc_voltage_v, dc_current_a
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **ROLLBACK PLAN**

### **Instant Disable (No Code Changes)**
```bash
# Set environment variable to 0
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECS_ENABLED=0

# Restart application if needed
# Users immediately see fallback behavior
```

### **Emergency Rollback (Git Revert)**
```bash
# If major issues arise
git revert edebaec
git push

# This removes all recommendation functionality
# Returns to pre-deployment state
```

### **Partial Rollback (Remove UI Only)**
```typescript
// Comment out in app/battery-chargers/page.tsx
{/* 
<RecommendationsBlock 
  filters={{...}} 
  fallbackItems={filteredParts} 
/> 
*/}
```
