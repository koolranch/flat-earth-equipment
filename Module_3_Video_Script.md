## Opening Hook (0:00-0:30)
**[VISUAL: Dramatic forklift tip-over simulation, then freeze-frame]**

**NARRATOR:** "This tip-over incident happened in under 3 seconds. The operator exceeded load capacity by just 500 pounds with the load center extended 6 inches beyond the standard 24-inch mark. The result: $50,000 in damage, two weeks of lost production, and an OSHA citation."

**[VISUAL: OSHA regulation text overlay]**

**NARRATOR:** "Under OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.178, understanding load capacity and stability isn't optional—it's the law. Today, we'll master the principles that prevent tip-overs and keep you safe."

## Capacity Plate: Your Legal Operating Limits (0:30-1:30)
**[VISUAL: Close-up of capacity plate with information highlighted]**

**NARRATOR:** "The capacity plate provides maximum safe load weight at a given load center. This isn't just a suggestion—it represents your legal operating limits under federal law."

**[VISUAL: Measuring tape showing 24-inch distance from fork face]**

**NARRATOR:** "The standard load-center distance used on most capacity plates is 24 inches. This is measured from the vertical face of the fork to the center of gravity of your load."

**[VISUAL: Animation showing load center calculation]**

**NARRATOR:** "For a standard pallet, this typically corresponds to the geometric center. But here's the critical point: as load center distance increases beyond 24 inches, your safe carrying capacity decreases dramatically."

**[VISUAL: Capacity reduction chart animation]**

**NARRATOR:** "At 30 inches load center, capacity drops to about 80%. At 36 inches, it's down to 65%. At 48 inches, you've lost half your capacity. Understanding this relationship could save your life."

## The Stability Triangle: Foundation of Safe Operation (1:30-2:45)
**[VISUAL: 3D animation showing forklift with stability triangle highlighted]**

**NARRATOR:** "Forklift stability is governed by the stability triangle—formed by two front wheels and the center of the rear axle. As long as the combined center of gravity stays within this triangle, the forklift remains upright."

**[VISUAL: Split-screen showing empty vs. loaded forklift center of gravity]**

**NARRATOR:** "An empty forklift has its center of gravity behind the front axle, well within the safety zone. But add a load, and watch what happens—the center of gravity shifts forward and upward."

**[VISUAL: Dynamic animation showing center of gravity movement with different loads]**

**NARRATOR:** "The heavier the load, the higher it's lifted, or the further the load center extends, the closer you get to the edge of that triangle. Cross the line, and physics takes over."

### Load Height and Stability Impact (2:15-2:45)
**[VISUAL: Side-view animation showing elevated load effects]**

**NARRATOR:** "Raising loads increases the height of the combined center of gravity, reducing lateral stability. This is why OSHA requires keeping loads as low as possible during travel—typically 4-6 inches above ground level."

**[VISUAL: Comparison of stable vs. unstable load heights during turns]**

**NARRATOR:** "Higher loads create exponentially greater tip-over risk during turns, on uneven surfaces, or during sudden directional changes. Don't let convenience compromise safety."

---

## Mast Tilt: Critical Safety Considerations (2:45-3:45)
**[VISUAL: Split-screen showing forward tilt vs. backward tilt effects]**

**NARRATOR:** "Mast tilt directly affects your stability and load security. Understanding proper tilt techniques can prevent catastrophic accidents."

### Forward Tilt Hazards (3:00-3:20)
**[VISUAL: Animation showing stability triangle shift with forward tilt]**

**NARRATOR:** "Critical safety fact: Tilting the mast forward while carrying a high load raises tip-over risk. Forward tilt moves your combined center of gravity closer to the front edge of the stability triangle."

**[VISUAL: Red warning overlay on forward-tilted loaded forklift]**

**NARRATOR:** "Forward tilt should only be used during load placement at ground level to facilitate load release. Never use forward tilt for travel or load securing."

### Backward Tilt Benefits (3:20-3:45)
**[VISUAL: Demonstration of proper backward tilt technique]**

**NARRATOR:** "Slight backward mast tilt during travel helps secure loads against the fork faces and load backrest. This prevents loads from sliding forward during acceleration or deceleration."

**[VISUAL: Optimal tilt angle measurement overlay]**

**NARRATOR:** "Use minimal backward tilt—typically 2-4 degrees—sufficient to secure the load without creating excessive stress on hydraulic systems or compromising your visibility."

---

## Proper Load Handling: The Fork Insertion Rule (3:45-4:45)
**[VISUAL: Side-by-side comparison of proper vs. improper fork insertion]**

**NARRATOR:** "One of the most critical safety procedures is often overlooked: fork insertion depth. You should fully insert forks under the pallet before lifting."

**[VISUAL: Animation showing partial insertion leading to load instability]**

**NARRATOR:** "Partial insertion creates instability and safety hazards. Loads can shift, slide, or fall during elevation, creating serious risks to you and nearby workers."

**[VISUAL: Proper technique demonstration with measurement overlay]**

**NARRATOR:** "Full insertion means your forks extend completely under the load, providing maximum support surface and preventing load movement during lifting and travel."

### Load Positioning Strategy (4:15-4:45)
**[VISUAL: Interactive demonstration showing light, medium, and heavy box placement]**

**NARRATOR:** "When handling multiple items, positioning strategy matters for both stability and visibility. Light boxes should be placed forward to preserve visibility. Medium boxes balance axle load distribution."

**[VISUAL: Heavy box placement near mast]**

**NARRATOR:** "Heavy boxes belong nearest the mast to lower the combined center of gravity. This isn't just good practice—it's OSHA requirement under section 29 CFR 1910.178(g)."

---

## Speed Limits and Travel Safety (4:45-5:45)
**[VISUAL: Speed limit signs in warehouse environment]**

**NARRATOR:** "OSHA establishes specific speed limits that operators must follow. Maximum travel speed in general work areas is 5 mph for both loaded and unloaded operations."

**[VISUAL: Pedestrian traffic areas with 3 mph overlay]**

**NARRATOR:** "In areas with pedestrian traffic, maximum speeds drop to 3 mph. These limits provide adequate stopping distance and reaction time for obstacle avoidance."

### Load-Specific Travel Rules (5:15-5:45)
**[VISUAL: Split-screen showing uphill vs. downhill travel orientation]**

**NARRATOR:** "Travel direction matters when dealing with grades. When traveling uphill with loads, orient with forks pointing uphill to prevent loads from sliding backward. When traveling downhill unloaded, point forks downhill to maintain proper weight distribution."

**[VISUAL: Speed reduction demonstration on ramps and turns]**

**NARRATOR:** "Reduce speed when turning or on wet surfaces. Your forklift handles differently when loaded, requiring increased turn radius and longer stopping distances."

---

## Attachment Operations and Capacity Changes (5:45-6:45)
**[VISUAL: Various attachments being installed on forklifts]**

**NARRATOR:** "Attachments change everything about your forklift's capacity and handling characteristics. Most attachments reduce rated capacity due to additional weight and changes in load center dynamics."

**[VISUAL: Capacity reduction chart for different attachments]**

**NARRATOR:** "Side shifters typically reduce capacity by 5-10% and increase load center by 2-3 inches. Fork extensions can reduce capacity by 25-40%. Complex attachments may require professional engineering analysis."

**[VISUAL: New capacity plate installation]**

**NARRATOR:** "When attachments are installed, new capacity plates must be installed showing the reduced ratings. Operating beyond these limits violates OSHA standards and creates serious liability."

### Attachment Training Requirements (6:15-6:45)
**[VISUAL: Operator receiving attachment-specific training]**

**NARRATOR:** "OSHA requires specific training for each attachment type. You cannot use attachments without proper certification and demonstrated competency. Each attachment changes how the forklift behaves."

**[VISUAL: Daily attachment inspection checklist]**

**NARRATOR:** "Attachments require daily inspection for proper mounting, hydraulic connections, and operational integrity as part of your pre-operation procedures."

## Emergency Procedures: When Things Go Wrong (6:45-7:45)
**[VISUAL: Tip-over prevention and response techniques]**

**NARRATOR:** "When capacity or stability incidents occur, proper response can mean the difference between an incident and a fatality."

### Tip-Over Response (6:55-7:15)
**[VISUAL: Seatbelt-restrained operator demonstrating proper technique]**

**NARRATOR:** "If a tip-over begins, remain seated, grip the steering wheel firmly, and lean away from the direction of fall. Never attempt to jump from a tipping forklift—more injuries occur from jumping than from staying with the forklift."

**[VISUAL: Gradual stability recovery demonstration]**

**NARRATOR:** "If tip-over is imminent but not inevitable, smooth reduction in speed and gradual load lowering may restore stability. Avoid sudden movements that could accelerate the tip-over."

### Load Drop Response (7:15-7:45)
**[VISUAL: Load drop warning procedures]**

**NARRATOR:** "If loads begin to fall, immediately sound your horn continuously to warn nearby personnel. Never attempt to catch or stop falling loads—focus on preventing injury to personnel in the area."

**[VISUAL: Post-incident inspection procedures]**

**NARRATOR:** "After any capacity-related incident, remove the forklift from service for comprehensive inspection before returning to operation. Document everything for investigation and corrective action."

---

## Practical Application: Load Assessment (7:45-8:30)
**[VISUAL: Step-by-step load assessment demonstration]**

**NARRATOR:** "Before every lift, conduct a practical assessment. First, verify load weight against your forklift's capacity plate. Don't guess—use shipping documents, scales, or visual estimation techniques."

**[VISUAL: Load center measurement techniques]**

**NARRATOR:** "Measure or estimate load center distance for non-standard loads. When in doubt, assume worst-case scenarios and apply additional safety margins."

**[VISUAL: Path planning demonstration]**

**NARRATOR:** "Plan your travel route before lifting, identifying potential hazards, clearance restrictions, and destination requirements. Preparation prevents accidents."

## Key Safety Principles Review (8:30-9:00)
**[VISUAL: Animated review of all key concepts]**

**NARRATOR:** "Remember these life-saving principles:"

**[VISUAL: Numbered list appearing on screen]**

1. **"Capacity plates provide maximum safe load weight at the given load center"**
2. **"Standard load-center distance is 24 inches from fork face to load center"**
3. **"Tilting the mast forward while carrying a high load raises tip-over risk"**
4. **"Always fully insert forks under the pallet before lifting"**
5. **"The stability triangle is formed by two front wheels and the rear axle center"**
6. **"Reduce speed when turning, on wet surfaces, or carrying loads"**
