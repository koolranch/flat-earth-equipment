crown,ic_mil_flash,"IC Engine - MIL Flash Method: Turn key to ON position (engine OFF); within 5 seconds, cycle the accelerator pedal from idle to full throttle 3 times; observe Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) flashing codes. Short pauses indicate individual digits; long pauses separate codes. Record all codes and operating conditions. To clear: resolve underlying issue or use Diagnostic Scan Tool (DST)."
crown,ic_scan_tool,"IC Engine - Scan Tool Method: Connect Diagnostic Scan Tool (DST) or EDIS to diagnostic port near controller; turn key ON; read Diagnostic Fault Codes (DFCs) from ECM; note active vs stored codes and freeze frame data. Verify with flash codes if available. Use tool to clear codes after repairs."
crown,electric_display,"Electric Models - Display Method: Power ON forklift; access main display panel; navigate to diagnostics or fault code menu (varies by model); view event codes on screen; record code number and any descriptive text. Note battery voltage and operating conditions. To reset: turn key OFF, wait 10 seconds, turn key ON. Codes may return if fault persists."
crown,electric_controller,"Electric Models - Controller Access: Key ON; locate main controller module (typically under seat or floor panel); check for LED fault indicators on controller face; count LED blink patterns if codes not displayed; refer to controller label for code interpretation. For advanced diagnostics, use Crown-approved scan tool."
crown,general,"General: Always perform visual inspection first - check for loose connections, damaged wiring, fluid leaks, and battery condition. Document all codes before clearing. If codes persist after repairs or are intermittent, contact Crown dealer or authorized service center. Do not operate equipment with critical faults (engine shutdown, throttle cut, safety-related codes)."
