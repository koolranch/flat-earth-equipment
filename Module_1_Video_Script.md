## Opening Hook (0:00-0:30)
**[VISUAL: Statistics overlay on industrial warehouse scene]**

**NARRATOR:** "Every year in America, forklifts are involved in 85 fatal accidents and 34,900 serious injuries requiring emergency treatment. But here's the critical fact: most of these accidents are completely preventable through proper training and pre-operation safety procedures."

**[VISUAL: OSHA logo and regulation text]**

**NARRATOR:** "Under federal law 29 CFR 1910.178, every forklift operator must be properly trained and demonstrate competency before operating any powered industrial truck. Today, we're going to learn the essential safety procedures that could save your life."

## Legal Requirements (0:30-1:15)
**[VISUAL: Age restriction graphics, training certificates]**

**NARRATOR:** "Before we begin, let's establish the legal requirements. Only individuals 18 years or older may operate forklifts in general industry. This age restriction is non-negotiable and applies to all employers under OSHA jurisdiction."

**[VISUAL: Training checklist animation]**

**NARRATOR:** "Every operator must successfully complete both classroom training and practical evaluation before being authorized to operate independently. This isn't just company policy—it's federal law designed to protect you and your coworkers."

## The Critical 4-Step Safety Process (1:15-3:30)
**[VISUAL: Split-screen showing operator and close-up of each step]**

**NARRATOR:** "Before moving a single inch, every forklift operation must begin with our critical 4-step safety process. Let's walk through each step."

### Step 1: Equip Personal Protective Equipment (1:30-2:00)
**[VISUAL: Close-up of high-visibility vest being put on]**

**NARRATOR:** "Step one: Equip your Personal Protective Equipment. The high-visibility vest is mandatory equipment—not optional. It must meet ANSI/ISEA 107 Class 2 standards. The bright colors and reflective striping make you visible to other equipment operators and pedestrians."

**[VISUAL: Hard hat being put on]**

**NARRATOR:** "Your hard hat must meet ANSI Z89.1 standards. In warehouse environments with overhead storage, head protection is critical. Steel-toed boots meeting ASTM F2413 standards protect against crushing injuries."

**[VISUAL: Operator wearing noise-cancelling earbuds with red X overlay]**

**NARRATOR:** "Important safety note: Noise-cancelling earbuds are prohibited. You must hear horns, alarms, and verbal warnings from coworkers."

### Step 2: Lower Forks to Ground Level (2:00-2:15)
**[VISUAL: Forks being lowered to floor level]**

**NARRATOR:** "Step two: Lower forks to ground level. This ensures forks aren't elevated, creating strike hazards, and prevents tip-over during your walk-around inspection."

### Step 3: Set Parking Brake (2:15-2:30)
**[VISUAL: Hand engaging parking brake lever]**

**NARRATOR:** "Step three: Set the parking brake firmly. This prevents truck movement during inspection and verifies brake system functionality. This is a required safety step per OSHA standards."

### Step 4: Visual Walk-Around Inspection (2:30-3:30)
**[VISUAL: Operator conducting thorough inspection around forklift]**

**NARRATOR:** "Step four: Conduct your visual walk-around inspection. Check tires for proper inflation and wear, inspect forks for cracks or damage, verify mast chains are properly lubricated, and ensure all safety systems are functioning."

**[VISUAL: Inspection checklist overlay]**

**NARRATOR:** "Any discovered defects must be immediately reported to supervision and the equipment removed from service. When in doubt, tag it out—your safety depends on it."

## Understanding Forklift Controls (3:30-5:00)
**[VISUAL: Close-up shots of each control being demonstrated]**

**NARRATOR:** "Understanding forklift controls is essential because forklifts operate fundamentally differently from passenger vehicles."

### Key Differences from Automobiles (3:45-4:30)
**[VISUAL: Split-screen comparison of car vs forklift steering]**

**NARRATOR:** "First, forklifts use rear-wheel steering, making them more maneuverable but less stable at higher speeds. This allows tight turns but requires slower speeds and greater attention to load balance."

**[VISUAL: Demonstration of fork travel height]**

**NARRATOR:** "During routine travel, forks should travel 4 to 6 inches above the floor. This height clears debris and surface irregularities while maintaining stability."

### Service Brake Purpose (4:30-5:00)
**[VISUAL: Foot pressing service brake pedal]**

**NARRATOR:** "The service brake serves as your primary means of slowing and stopping the truck under normal operating conditions. Unlike passenger vehicles, don't use the brake pedal for routine parking—use the parking brake instead."

## Workplace Safety Requirements (5:00-6:30)
**[VISUAL: Busy warehouse with multiple forklifts and pedestrians]**

**NARRATOR:** "Operating safely requires understanding your workplace environment and interaction with others."

### High-Visibility Vest Requirements (5:15-6:00)
**[VISUAL: Operator in marked aisles without vest, then red X overlay]**

**NARRATOR:** "Critical safety fact: You may NOT operate a forklift without a high-visibility vest, even if you remain in marked aisles. Some workers incorrectly believe that staying in designated travel lanes eliminates this requirement. This is false—the vest requirement applies to all forklift operations."

### Safe Distances and Speed Limits (6:00-6:30)
**[VISUAL: Animation showing safe distances]**

**NARRATOR:** "Maintain at least 10 feet separation from pedestrians. When multiple forklifts operate in the same area, maintain three truck lengths minimum following distance. Always comply with posted speed limits and reduce speeds when conditions warrant."

---

## OSHA Compliance and Legal Responsibility (6:30-7:30)
**[VISUAL: OSHA documentation and inspection forms]**

**NARRATOR:** "OSHA requires comprehensive documentation of all inspection activities. This isn't just paperwork—it's legal proof of compliance that protects you, your coworkers, and your employer."

**[VISUAL: Equipment with "DO NOT OPERATE" tag]**

**NARRATOR:** "Never ignore defects or warning lights. Operating defective equipment violates OSHA standards and creates serious liability. Operators are legally responsible for refusing to operate unsafe equipment."

---

## Key Safety Principles Review (7:30-8:30)
**[VISUAL: Animated review of all 4 steps]**

**NARRATOR:** "Let's review the key safety principles that could save your life:"

**[VISUAL: Numbered list appearing on screen]**

1. **"Daily pre-operation inspection is mandatory—never optional under any circumstances"**
2. **"High-visibility vests are required for ALL forklift operations"**
3. **"Forks travel 4-6 inches above the floor during routine operation"**
4. **"Service brakes are for slowing and stopping under normal conditions"**
5. **"When in doubt about any safety issue, tag it out immediately"**

## Closing and Call to Action (8:30-9:00)
**[VISUAL: Operator successfully completing all 4 steps]**

**NARRATOR:** "Remember, these aren't just company procedures—they're federal safety requirements designed to protect lives. Every time you operate a forklift, you're responsible for your safety and the safety of everyone around you."

**[VISUAL: Flat Earth Equipment logo]**

**NARRATOR:** "Following these procedures isn't just about compliance—it's about coming home safely every day. In our next module, we'll dive deeper into the complete daily inspection checklist that ensures your equipment is safe to operate."
