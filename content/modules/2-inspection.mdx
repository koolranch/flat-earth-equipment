## OSHA Pre-Operation Inspection Requirements

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) mandates comprehensive pre-operation inspections for all powered industrial trucks under **29 CFR 1910.178**. These requirements are not suggestions—they are federal law designed to prevent the **85 fatal accidents** and **34,900 serious injuries** that occur annually from forklift operations.

:::caution
29 CFR 1910.178(q)(7) – "Industrial trucks shall be examined before being placed in service on each day of use to determine that the vehicle is in safe operating condition. Any defects when found shall be immediately reported and corrected."
:::

Every operator has a legal responsibility under **29 CFR 1910.178(l)(3)(i)(P)** for "operator inspection and maintenance" to ensure their equipment meets safety standards before operation begins. This regulation requires operators to conduct thorough examinations of critical safety systems, mechanical components, and operational controls.

**Pre-operation inspection is mandatory**—not optional. Skipping this requirement violates federal safety standards and puts you, your coworkers, and your employer at serious legal and financial risk.

## The 8-Point Visual Inspection System

OSHA's inspection requirements encompass eight critical areas that must be examined before each shift. Each point addresses potential failure modes that have historically caused serious accidents, equipment damage, and regulatory violations.

<Flash q="Which item is part of OSHAs daily forklift inspection checklist?" a="Hydraulic hoses are a mandatory part of OSHA's daily forklift inspection checklist, along with tires, forks, mast chains, battery, overhead guard, seat-belt, and data plate." />

### 1. Tire and Wheel Assembly Inspection

**Regulatory Basis**: Tire failure represents one of the most common causes of forklift accidents, particularly in industrial environments where debris, oils, and uneven surfaces create hazardous conditions.

**Critical Inspection Points**:
- **Tread Depth**: Minimum 1/16" remaining tread depth across the entire tire surface
- **Sidewall Integrity**: No cuts deeper than 1/4" or bulges indicating internal damage
- **Inflation Pressure**: Check against manufacturer specifications (typically 50-80 PSI for pneumatic tires)
- **Wear Patterns**: Even wear indicates proper alignment; uneven wear suggests mechanical issues
- **Foreign Objects**: Remove any debris, nails, or metal fragments embedded in treads

**Action Required**: Any tire showing **25% or greater wear** must be reported immediately and the forklift tagged out of service until replacement.

### 2. Fork and Carriage Assembly

**Regulatory Basis**: Fork failure can result in catastrophic load drops, crushing injuries, and property damage. OSHA requires specific measurements and visual inspections to prevent structural failures.

**Critical Inspection Points**:
- **Heel Wear**: Maximum **10% of original thickness** wear allowed before mandatory replacement
- **Crack Detection**: Any visible crack, regardless of size, requires immediate tag-out
- **Straightness Verification**: Forks must be parallel within manufacturer tolerances
- **Mounting Security**: No play or looseness in fork-to-carriage attachment points
- **Surface Condition**: No severe gouging, pitting, or material deformation

**Measurement Standards**: Use calipers to verify heel thickness. Original thickness specifications are found on the forklift's data plate or operator manual.

### 3. Mast Chain and Hydraulic System

**Regulatory Basis**: Chain and hydraulic failures can cause uncontrolled load drops, mast collapse, and severe crushing injuries. These systems operate under extreme stress and require daily verification.

**Mast Chain Inspection**:
- **Lubrication Status**: Chains must be properly oiled with manufacturer-specified lubricant
- **Link Integrity**: **Two or more broken links** require immediate chain replacement
- **Tension Verification**: Proper tension per manufacturer specifications
- **Wear Assessment**: Look for elongated, twisted, or kinked links

**Hydraulic System Inspection**:
- **Cylinder Rod Condition**: Clean surface with no scoring, pitting, or oil film residue
- **Hose Integrity**: No cracks, abrasion, bulging, or fluid seepage
- **Fitting Tightness**: All connections secure with no visible leaks
- **Fluid Level**: Check reservoir when forks are fully lowered

### 4. Audible Warning Systems

**Regulatory Basis**: Horn and backup alarm systems are required safety devices under OSHA standards. These systems must be **audible at 50 feet** in normal workplace ambient noise conditions.

**Testing Requirements**:
- **Horn Function**: Must produce loud, continuous tone when activated
- **Backup Alarm**: Automatic activation when transmission in reverse
- **Volume Standards**: Audible throughout designated work areas
- **Response Time**: Immediate activation with no delay or intermittent operation

**Documentation**: Test results must be recorded on daily inspection forms with any deficiencies reported immediately.

<Flash q="True / False — A working horn is optional if the warehouse has mirrors at intersections." a="False. A working horn is mandatory per OSHA regulations regardless of mirrors or other safety equipment. Visual aids supplement but do not replace audible warning requirements." />

### 5. Lighting and Visibility Systems

**Regulatory Basis**: Adequate lighting prevents collisions, improves load handling accuracy, and ensures compliance with workplace visibility standards.

**Inspection Requirements**:
- **Headlight Function**: All bulbs illuminate properly with no flickering
- **Strobe/Warning Lights**: Proper operation of all visibility enhancement equipment
- **Lens Condition**: No cracks, damage, or significant dimming
- **Mounting Security**: Lights properly secured and aimed correctly

**Replacement Standards**: Cracked lenses must be replaced immediately as they can shatter under vibration, creating safety hazards and reducing light output.

### 6. Battery and Electrical Systems

**Regulatory Basis**: Battery-related accidents can cause severe chemical burns, toxic gas exposure, and electrical shock. Daily inspection prevents most battery-related incidents.

**Battery Inspection Points**:
- **Terminal Condition**: Clean terminals with no corrosion buildup
- **Cap Security**: All filler caps tight and properly seated
- **Electrolyte Level**: Proper fluid level in all chambers (flooded batteries)
- **Case Integrity**: No cracks, leaks, or physical damage to battery housing
- **Ventilation**: Clear battery compartment ventilation passages

**Safety Protocols**: Always wear appropriate PPE when inspecting batteries. Ensure adequate ventilation to prevent hydrogen gas accumulation.

### 7. Overhead Guard Structural Integrity

**Regulatory Basis**: The overhead guard (FOPS - Falling Object Protective Structure) must maintain structural integrity to protect operators from falling objects and tip-over incidents.

**Critical Inspection Areas**:
- **Post Condition**: No bent, cracked, or damaged support posts
- **Weld Integrity**: All structural welds intact with no visible cracks
- **Mounting Points**: Secure attachment to forklift frame
- **Mesh/Screen Condition**: Protective screens intact and properly secured

**Tag-Out Criteria**: Any structural damage to the overhead guard requires immediate removal from service. This is a **safety-critical component** with zero tolerance for defects.

### 8. Data Plate and Capacity Information

**Regulatory Basis**: The data plate provides essential load capacity, weight distribution, and safety information required for legal operation under OSHA standards.

**Verification Requirements**:
- **Plate Presence**: Data plate must be present and securely mounted
- **Legibility**: All capacity information clearly readable
- **Accuracy**: Information matches actual forklift configuration
- **Completeness**: No missing or damaged portions of critical data

<Flash q="The data plate tells you:" a="The data plate tells you truck weight & load capacity information, including maximum safe load limits, load center distances, and lifting heights for legal operation." />
