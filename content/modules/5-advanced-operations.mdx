## OSHA Shutdown and Parking Requirements

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) establishes comprehensive requirements for powered industrial truck shutdown, parking, and end-of-shift procedures under **29 CFR 1910.178**. These regulations address the critical transition period when operators complete their shifts, creating specific protocols to prevent runaway trucks, workplace injuries, and equipment damage.

:::caution
29 CFR 1910.178(m)(5)(ii) – "Fully lower forks, neutralize controls, shut off power, set brakes."
:::

**Statistical Context**: Improper shutdown procedures contribute to approximately **15% of forklift-related workplace accidents**, often involving uncontrolled movement, falling loads, or operator injuries during dismounting. These incidents are entirely preventable through adherence to OSHA-mandated shutdown sequences and parking protocols.

**Regulatory Framework**: OSHA's parking and shutdown requirements under **29 CFR 1910.178(m)(5)–(7)** mandate specific sequences designed to eliminate hazards associated with equipment abandonment, electrical systems, and inclined surface operations.

---

## Proper Shutdown Sequence

OSHA requires a specific sequence of shutdown actions designed to eliminate each potential hazard in order of safety priority. This sequence prevents runaway trucks, load drops, and operator injuries that can occur during improper shutdown procedures.

### Mandatory Shutdown Steps

**Regulatory Basis**: **29 CFR 1910.178(m)(5)(i)** requires that "when parking a powered industrial truck, the load engaging means shall be fully lowered, controls neutralized, power shut off, and brakes set" in the proper sequence.

**The proper shutdown sequence begins with**:

1. **Shift to neutral** - Direction lever to neutral position (FIRST STEP)
2. **Center steering wheel** - Align wheels for straight exit path
3. **Set parking brake** - Engage firmly and completely
4. **Lower forks fully** - Flat on ground level with mast tilted forward to relieve pressure
5. **Turn key off** - Remove key from ignition and pocket it
6. **Connect charger** (electric) or refuel (LP gas) - Using proper PPE
7. **Place wheel chock** - On downhill tire if on any incline

<Flash q="The proper shutdown sequence begins with:" a="Shift to neutral - The proper shutdown sequence begins with shifting to neutral to prevent runaway movement if the parking brake fails during the shutdown process." />

### Critical First Step: Neutral Position

**Regulatory Requirement**: The neutral position must be the first step in any shutdown sequence to comply with OSHA's control neutralization requirements.

**Safety Rationale**: **Always shift to neutral first** before any other shutdown action. This prevents runaway truck movement if the parking brake mechanism fails or is improperly engaged during the shutdown sequence. The neutral position disconnects power transmission to the wheels, creating a mechanical safety barrier against uncontrolled movement.

**Operator Positioning**: Ensure you remain seated with full control of the steering wheel and brake pedal while shifting to neutral. Never attempt to dismount until the complete shutdown sequence is finished.

### Steering and Brake Engagement

**Steering Alignment**: **Center steering wheel for straight exit** to ensure clear egress path and prevent interference with pedestrian traffic or other equipment. Proper wheel alignment also reduces stress on steering components during long-term parking.

**Parking Brake Application**: **Set parking brake firmly** with full engagement verified. The parking brake must hold the truck stationary on level surfaces and approved inclines. Test brake holding capacity before leaving the operator compartment.

### Load Engaging Means Control

**Regulatory Basis**: **29 CFR 1910.178(m)(5)(ii)** specifically requires that load engaging means (forks, attachments) be "fully lowered" before power shutdown.

**Fork Positioning**: **Lower forks flat on ground level** to eliminate struck-by hazards for pedestrians and prevent load drops from elevated positions. **Tilt mast forward to relieve pressure** on hydraulic systems and reduce stress on mechanical components.

**Attachment Considerations**: When equipped with attachments (clamps, rotators, spreaders), ensure all attachment functions are fully retracted and secured before power shutdown.

## Parking Requirements and Incline Procedures

OSHA establishes specific parking location requirements and procedures for inclined surfaces that address the unique hazards associated with powered industrial truck storage and overnight positioning.

:::caution
29 CFR 1910.178(n)(7) – "Parking on inclines shall be avoided. Where parking on an incline cannot be avoided, the wheels shall be blocked."
:::

### Designated Parking Areas

**Regulatory Basis**: **29 CFR 1910.178(p)(1)** requires that "trucks shall be parked in designated areas only" to prevent interference with emergency egress routes and workplace traffic patterns.

**Approved Parking Criteria**:
- **Level surfaces** - Maximum 3% grade under normal conditions
- **Marked zones** - Clearly designated parking areas only
- **Clear of fire exits** - Maintain emergency egress routes per NFPA standards
- **Away from traffic** - Not blocking travel aisles or intersections
- **Protected location** - Shelter from weather when possible
- **Adequate ventilation** - Especially important for battery charging areas

### Incline Parking Procedures

**Regulatory Basis**: While OSHA states that "parking on inclines shall be avoided," **29 CFR 1910.178(n)(7)** provides specific requirements when incline parking becomes necessary due to workplace constraints.

**When parking on a slight ramp you must**:
1. **Complete standard shutdown sequence** through neutral and brake settings
2. **Chock at least one wheel** - Minimum requirement for incline parking
3. **Position chock on downhill side** - Against tire contact with no gaps
4. **Ensure chock proper sizing** - Minimum 1/4 wheel height for effectiveness
5. **Verify brake engagement** - Parking brake must be fully set before chocking
6. **Report recurring issues** - Notify supervision if incline parking becomes routine

<Flash q="When parking on a slight ramp you must:" a="Chock at least one wheel - When parking on any incline, OSHA requires wheel chocking as the minimum safety requirement to prevent truck movement due to brake failure or inadequate parking brake capacity." />

### Wheel Chocking Standards

**Regulatory Basis**: Wheel chocking represents the final safety barrier against runaway truck movement on inclined surfaces, required by OSHA when level parking areas are unavailable.

**Chocking Specifications**:
- **Chock positioned** on downhill side against tire contact
- **Chock snug** against tire with no gaps or movement
- **Chock properly sized** - Minimum 1/4 wheel height for adequate resistance
- **Chock material** - Approved materials meeting industrial standards
- **Chock storage** - Designated hook or storage location when not in use

**Installation Procedure**: Position chock firmly against the downhill tire before releasing parking brake tension. Verify chock stability and proper tire contact before leaving the truck unattended.

## Fork Positioning and Load Engaging Means Safety

OSHA establishes specific requirements for fork positioning and load engaging means that address struck-by hazards, ergonomic considerations, and workplace safety protocols.

### Fork Height Regulations

**Regulatory Basis**: **29 CFR 1910.178(m)(5)** requires that load engaging means be "fully lowered" during parking to eliminate struck-by hazards for pedestrians and other workers.

**Fork Positioning Requirements**:
- **Forks completely lowered** - Flat on ground level during all parking
- **Never leave forks raised** - Even in "secure" or fenced areas
- **Clear travel lanes** - Forks positioned to avoid pedestrian interference
- **Mast tilt forward** - Relieve hydraulic pressure during parking
- **Attachment securing** - All attachment functions fully retracted

**False Safety Claims**: **Forks may remain raised if the area is fenced and no pedestrians enter** is a **false** statement. OSHA requires forks to be fully lowered during all parking operations regardless of area security, fencing, or pedestrian restrictions. Raised forks create struck-by hazards for maintenance personnel, cleaning crews, and emergency responders who may need to access the area unexpectedly.

<Flash q="True / False — Forks may remain raised if the area is fenced and no pedestrians enter." a="False - Forks may remain raised if the area is fenced and no pedestrians enter is false. OSHA requires forks to be fully lowered during all parking operations regardless of area security, fencing, or pedestrian access restrictions." />

### Load Engaging Means Inspection

**Pre-Shutdown Assessment**:
