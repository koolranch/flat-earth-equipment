### Serial Plate Locations
Telehandlers typically place the plate near the cab entry or chassis frame rails. Skid steers/compact equipment may use the engine bay or operator area.

### Decoding Basics
Serial/PIN conventions vary by product line. Use model family and serial together to identify parts supersessions.

### Quick Fault Workflow
1. Check fluid levels and grade specs (engine, transmission, hydraulics).
2. Read active/stored codes via dash diagnostics menu.
3. Inspect DEF and emissions connectors on Tier 4/Stage V equipment.

### Safety Notes
- Support booms before hydraulic work.
- Observe manufacturer torque and cleanliness requirements for hydraulic fittings.
