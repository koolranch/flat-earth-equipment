### Serial Plate Locations
Look on the dash cowl, near the operator compartment, or on the frame near the counterweight. Some units have an additional stamped frame ID.

### Decoding Basics
Model identifies series/configuration (e.g., 8F series). Serial may not directly encode year; use running serial ranges and plant information when available.

### Quick Fault Workflow
1. Confirm 12V/24V supplies and contactor health.
2. Read E-codes on the dash where available.
3. Inspect accelerator and steer angle sensor connectors for intermittent.

### Safety Notes
- Block forks/mast before working under loads.
- Follow proper battery handling and ventilation practices.
