### Serial Plate Locations
Often on the chassis near the ground controls or inside the platform control area. Some scissor models place it on the entry side of the platform.

### Decoding Basics
Genie serial labels include model and build identifiers. Use the exact model variant (e.g., GS-1930 vs GS-1932) and serial to align parts and service information.

### Quick Fault Workflow
1. Confirm battery pack voltage under load.
2. Retrieve codes via onboard display.
3. Check pot/sensor connectors and magnet clearances.

### Safety Notes
- Support elevated structures before servicing.
- Keep personnel clear of pinch points during boom/scissor cycling.
