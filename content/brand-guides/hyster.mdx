### Serial Plate Locations
Typically on the cowl/dashboard area or frame near the counterweight. Electric models may include controller or battery labels with additional IDs.

### Decoding Basics
Hyster serials often include plant and series cues. Use the full serial to resolve mid-series component changes.

### Quick Fault Workflow
1. Verify seat/OPS and accelerator sensor inputs.
2. Read DTCs in the service/diagnostic menu.
3. Inspect main harness sections for flex or heat damage.

### Safety Notes
- Secure the mast/attachments before working nearby.
- Disconnect battery and discharge capacitors where applicable.
