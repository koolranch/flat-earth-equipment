Shaft mounted forks are specialized attachments designed for use on various types of material handling equipment such as forklifts and telehandlers. These forks are connected to the machinery through a shaft or bar that is mounted on the carriage, providing a secure and stable method of lifting and moving loads.

The design of shaft mounted forks allows for a quick and easy way to attach or detach them from the machine. This feature is essential for enhancing operational efficiency in settings that require frequent changes in attachments.

Manufactured in a range of sizes and capacities, shaft mounted forks cater to a wide array of lifting needs and are compatible with equipment from popular brands like JLG, Caterpillar, and Genie.

Made from high-grade materials like boron-carbon steel, these forks are designed to withstand the rigorous demands of various environments, including construction sites and warehouses.

Their build quality ensures that they can effectively absorb impact and sustain heavy loads without compromising safety.

Selecting the right shaft mounted forks involves determining the appropriate dimensions and specifications required for specific applications.

Factors such as the centerline distance of the shafts, lifting capacity, fork length, width, and thickness are crucial for ensuring the optimal performance of the attachment.

Proper selection and maintenance of these forks ensure the safety of operators and help prevent potential accidents during material handling operations.
Shaft Mounted Forks Fundamentals

Shaft mounted forks are integral components for material handling tasks, designed to be mounted on the machinery's carriage via shafts. Their design and compatibility are critical for safe and efficient load handling.
Design and Types

Shaft mounted forks are typically **forged** from high-grade **steel** to ensure durability and strength. There are different **types** of shaft mount configurations to cater to varying load requirements and applications.

**Pin-type forks** are common, which secure to the **carriage** using a **pin** across the width, enhancing stability.
Compatibility and Attachment

Compatibility with equipment like **telehandlers** and **forklifts** from manufacturers including **JLG**, **Caterpillar**, **Genie**, and others is paramount.

The **attachment** process involves sliding the forks onto the shaft and securing them with a pin, which is an industry-standard method used by companies like **Arrow** for reliable and quick fork exchanges.
Safety and Standards

Adherence to safety standards like **ISO 3834-2** is non-negotiable for ensuring operator well-being and overall workplace safety.

Every fork must meet these international standards for welding quality, which reflects on the **reliability** and **load** bearing capacity of the forks.
Operational Considerations

**Operators** should know the exact **measurements** and weight limits of their shaft mounted forks to prevent mishandling of **pallets** or loads.

The forks should be inspected regularly for signs of wear or damage to preserve integrity during **extreme** working conditions.
Industry Applications

Shaft mounted forks are used in diverse sectors, including logistics, construction, and agriculture. They handle materials across all industries, with robust design suited to intensive use in sites operated by companies like **Pettibone**, **Gehl**, **Gradall**, and **Skytrak**.

The various applications emphasize the importance of proper forks selection based on the specific requirements of the **production** and **load** to be moved.
