<p>The serial number on a New Holland skid steer is a unique identifier crucial for verifying the model and year of manufacture. This information assists owners in obtaining accurate parts and service information.</p>
<h3>Locating the Serial Number</h3>
<p>The serial number, often abbreviated as "s/n," is typically located on a metal <strong>VIN plate</strong> strategically affixed to the skid steer. </p>
<p>One should inspect the following areas to locate this plate:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lower rear area of the machine, near the back door</li>
<li>Inside the cab, near the operator's seat, usually on the side walls or under the seat</li>
</ul>
<p>The VIN plate may vary in location by model, but these are common sites where one could expect to find it. </p>
<p>Ensuring visibility and access to the VIN plate is important for easy identification.</p>
<h3>Model and Year Verification</h3>
<p>Once the serial number is located, it can be used to determine the specific <strong>model</strong> and <strong>year</strong> of the New Holland skid steer. This verification process involves:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recording the serial number from the VIN plate.</li>
<li>Comparing the serial number to New Holland's model and year reference charts.</li>
</ol>
<p>These charts are often accessible through New Holland dealers or their customer service resources. </p>
<p>They depict serial number ranges assigned to each skid steer model and year. </p>
<p>Cross-referencing the s/n with these charts will enable the owner to confirm the model and year of their equipment.</p>
