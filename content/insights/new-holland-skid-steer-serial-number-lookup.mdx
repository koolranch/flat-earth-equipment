## 🔍 Where to Find the Serial Number

The serial number (or VIN) is commonly found on:
- A metal plate at the rear lower frame
- Inside the cab, under or near the operator's seat

This VIN plate may vary in location based on model year. Always ensure it's visible and intact for service or resale purposes.

## 📅 Decoding the Serial Number

To determine model and year:
1. Record the serial number
2. Contact a New Holland dealer or use an online reference chart
3. Cross-check against year-based lookup tables for verification

This process helps confirm the machine's origin and avoids errors during parts ordering.
