Forklift forks, also referred to as tines or blades, are integral components of forklift trucks. These horizontal attachments are responsible for the lifting and carrying of loads.

They come in various classes to match different forklift capacities and applications.

Class 3 forklift forks are designed for a specific category within the Industrial Truck Association (ITA) classifications. They are typically used on larger forklifts that have a capacity range between 5,500 pounds and 10,500 pounds, making them suitable for medium to heavy-duty tasks.

The ITA class system is a standardized method to ensure that forklift forks are compatible with the appropriate forklift carriage.

Class 3 forklift forks are manufactured to fit the carriage of class 3 forklifts securely, enabling them to perform optimally while maintaining safety standards.

The dimensions of the forks, including length, width, and thickness, are essential for balancing and lifting loads properly, and these specifications are meticulously standardized in Class 3 forks to align with the lifting capacities that these forklifts can handle.

Selecting the right class of forklift forks is crucial for both the efficiency and safety of material handling operations.

Using a Class 3 set of forks with compatible forklifts ensures that heavy loads can be moved securely without overburdening the equipment.

Operators and businesses must ensure they are utilizing the correct class of forklift forks to guarantee that their operations are both productive and aligned with safety regulations.
Forklift Fork Types and Specifications

Forklift forks, essential for the lifting and handling of materials, come in various classes, with Class 3 being a common category. The specifications of these forks play a crucial role in their strength and suitability for different load types.
Class 3 Fork Design

Class 3 forks are designed for heavier lifting compared to Class 2, with a greater load center typically at 24 inches.

The design includes a specific **mounting class**, which in this case is the ITA hook type, ensuring a secure fit to the forklift carriage.

These forks are widely used in industries where larger and heavier materials require transportation.
Dimensional Attributes

**Fork dimensions** for Class 3 typically feature **fork lengths** ranging from 42 to 96 inches and **fork widths** that can vary according to the required capacity.

 	- **Length:** 42-96 inches

 	- **Width:** Standard widths starting at 4 inches

 	- **Thickness:** Varies with capacity requirements

 	- **Fork width and thickness** are related to the fork's ability to handle specific **load centers** and weights.

In addition, the transition from the **shank** to the **blade** is fashioned in several **fork taper styles** and **tip styles**, like full taper or block forks, improving the ease of insertion and retrieval from a load.
Forklift Fork Materials

Class 3 forklift forks are typically manufactured from heat-treated boron-carbon alloy steel, offering the perfect balance of strength and durability required for heavy loads.

| Material |
| Heat-treated boron-carbon alloy steel |

| **Fork Styles** |
| ITA Hook Type, Bolt-on Forks, Drum handling forks |

| **Fork Wear** |
| Replacement recommended when wear exceeds 10% of fork thickness |

Additional features like **fork extension**, **block forks**, and **heel** reinforcement may be incorporated depending on the intended use and the type of materials handled.

Forklift fork extensions are used to temporarily extend the reach of the forks, while the heel is often reinforced for additional wear resistance.
Operational Guidelines and Safety Standards

When operating Class 3 forklift forks, adhering to proper usage and safety regulations is crucial for ensuring efficient material handling and minimizing the risk of accidents.
Appropriate Fork Usage

Class 3 forklift forks are designed for specific load capacities and heights.

Operators must select the correct fork size, typically ranging from **36”** to **96”** in length, to handle their material load safely.

Using an undersized fork for a heavy load can lead to safety hazards.

Fork orders need to specify the right **capacity** and **height** for the task.

**ITA carriages** should match the forklift blades by size and class to ensure a secure connection.

Forks should be correctly inserted into the carriage with the **positioning lock** securely in place, strictly following the **ISO 2330** standards.

 	- List of common fork lengths:

 	- 36"

 	- 48"

 	- 60"

 	- 72"

 	- 96"

Maintenance and Inspection

Consistent maintenance and inspections are mandatory to ensure Class 3 forklift forks are functioning correctly.

Inspection should include checking for any signs of cracks, bends, or excessive wear.

**Flat Earth Equipment** offers nationwide delivery and recommends that both **shaft mount forks** and the **carriage height** mechanisms be included in the inspection routine.

 	- Inspection Checklist:

 	- Check for cracks or bends

 	- Inspect for wear

 	- Verify carriage height and condition

 	- Ensure fork attachment is secure

Compliance with Safety Regulations

Safety is of utmost importance in the operation of lift truck forks.

Organizations must comply with the safety regulations across North America.

Brands like **Genie** and **JLG** manufacture equipment to these safety standards.

For Class 3 forklifts, which are ideal for lifting loads in a medium-capacity range, the regulations ensure the forklift is used within its operational limits.

They also ensure that operators are trained in recognizing the different Class 3 and Class 4 forklift forks.
