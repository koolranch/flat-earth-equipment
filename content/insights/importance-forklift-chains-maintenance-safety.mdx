# Importance of Forklift Chains: Maintenance, Inspection, and Safety

Forklift chains are the backbone of your lift truck's lifting mechanism. Proper maintenance and regular inspection of these critical components are essential for safe operation and preventing costly downtime. This comprehensive guide will help you understand the importance of forklift chains and how to maintain them properly.

## Understanding Forklift Chain Components

### Primary Components
- **Load Chains**: The main lifting chains that support the carriage
- **Anchor Chains**: Secures the chains to the mast
- **Chain Guides**: Ensures proper chain alignment
- **Chain Tensioners**: Maintains proper chain tension

### Chain Types
1. **Grade 80 Chains**
   - Standard duty applications
   - General warehouse use
   - Moderate load capacities

2. **Grade 100 Chains**
   - Heavy-duty applications
   - High-capacity lifts
   - Industrial environments

## Daily Inspection Checklist

### Visual Inspection
- [ ] Check for visible wear or damage
- [ ] Look for rust or corrosion
- [ ] Verify proper chain tension
- [ ] Inspect chain guides for wear
- [ ] Check for proper lubrication

### Operational Checks
- [ ] Smooth chain movement
- [ ] No unusual noises
- [ ] Proper chain alignment
- [ ] Correct chain tension
- [ ] No binding or sticking

## Wear Indicators

### Critical Signs of Wear
1. **Chain Stretch**
   - Measure chain length
   - Compare to manufacturer specifications
   - Replace if stretch exceeds 3%

2. **Link Wear**
   - Check for worn link pins
   - Inspect for link plate wear
   - Look for bent or damaged links

3. **Corrosion**
   - Surface rust
   - Pitting
   - Discoloration
