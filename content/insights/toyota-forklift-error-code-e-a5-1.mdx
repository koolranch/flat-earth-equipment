## 🔍 What Causes Code E A5-1?

The E A5-1 code means the forklift's onboard computer is detecting inconsistent feedback from the **vehicle speed control circuit**. Common culprits include:

- Damaged or bypassed seat switch  
- Faulty accelerator potentiometer  
- Disruptions in CAN network communication  
- Fuel feedback or hour meter discrepancies

## ⚡️ Step-by-Step Diagnostic Flow

### 1. **Visual Inspection**
- Check wiring harness for corrosion  
- Confirm seat switch isn't bypassed  
- Inspect accelerator pedal for drift  

### 2. **Plug In Diagnostic Tool**
- Read stored fault codes  
- Identify related errors in throttle, CAN system, or hour meter

### 3. **CAN Communication Check**
- Use analyzer tool to test continuity  
- Validate ECU handshake  
- Inspect sensor response logs

## 🧰 Common Component Checks

| Component | Fault Symptom                     | Fix                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Seat switch | Forklift won't engage drive     | Replace or reseat   |
| Potentiometer | Inconsistent idle/surge       | Recalibrate or swap |
| Hour meter | Errors in service logic          | Reset or replace    |
| CAN bus | Flashing warnings, delayed input    | Reseat all relays   |

## 🔁 Reset Procedure (Basic)

1. Turn key to "ON" (engine off)  
2. Press and hold instrument cluster button  
3. After 10 seconds, turn key OFF  
4. Release button  
5. Restart forklift — light should be cleared

## 📊 Using the Diagnosis Memory Menu

Access the built-in **diagnosis memory** to view fault code history:

- Tap and hold selector to enter code log  
- Note recurring issues (especially A5-series)  
- Clear log once repair is complete

---

## 🧪 Advanced Troubleshooting Tools

- **Plug-in Analyzer** – Real-time CAN signal monitor  
- **Throttle Sensor Voltage Test** – Check for correct response curve  
- **Tilt Lever Feedback** – Detects hydraulics and travel errors

---

## 🛠️ Maintenance for Prevention

Keep systems clean and tight:
- Battery voltage above 12.2V  
- Harness connections snug and rust-free  
- Replace filters and run software resets monthly
