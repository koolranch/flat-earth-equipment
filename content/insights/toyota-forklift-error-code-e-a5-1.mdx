## üîç What Causes Code E A5-1?

The E A5-1 code means the forklift's onboard computer is detecting inconsistent feedback from the **vehicle speed control circuit**. Common culprits include:

- Damaged or bypassed seat switch  
- Faulty accelerator potentiometer  
- Disruptions in CAN network communication  
- Fuel feedback or hour meter discrepancies

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Step-by-Step Diagnostic Flow

### 1. **Visual Inspection**
- Check wiring harness for corrosion  
- Confirm seat switch isn't bypassed  
- Inspect accelerator pedal for drift  

### 2. **Plug In Diagnostic Tool**
- Read stored fault codes  
- Identify related errors in throttle, CAN system, or hour meter

### 3. **CAN Communication Check**
- Use analyzer tool to test continuity  
- Validate ECU handshake  
- Inspect sensor response logs
