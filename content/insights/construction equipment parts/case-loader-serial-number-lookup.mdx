# Case Loader Serial Number Lookup: The Expert 2025 Identification Guide

In the high-stakes world of construction and earthmoving, the difference between a project finishing on time and a week of idle machinery often boils down to a single identification number. For owners of **Case loaders**, your serial number (PIN - Product Identification Number) is the DNA of your machine.

As we move into 2025, Case Construction Equipment has introduced complex revisions across their **SV-Series** and **B-Series** lineups, including advanced Stage V emissions hardware and updated electro-hydraulic (EH) controls. Relying on "model year" is no longer a viable strategy for parts procurement. This guide, authored by our veteran Case parts specialists, provides the definitive roadmap for locating, decoding, and utilizing your serial number for 100% accuracy.

## 🛠️ The 2025 Identification Landscape: Why the Serial Number is King

We frequently hear from owners who say, *"I need a starter for my 2015 Case 580N."* While helpful, Case often implements "mid-cycle" updates—such as switching from a Bosch to a Denso starter or changing hydraulic seal kits—without changing the model year.

**Expert Insight:** Case loaders built in the Burlington, IA, or Wichita, KS, plants may have different internal componentry for the same model year depending on the specific production block. Using the serial number eliminates the "maybe" and ensures you get the right part the first time, every time.

### Why the Serial Number Beats the Year:
- **Exact Engine Tier:** Differentiates between Tier 4 Interim, Tier 4 Final, and Stage V emissions systems.
- **Hydraulic Specifics:** Maps your machine to the exact pump displacement and valve configurations.
- **Transmission Mapping:** Crucial for Powershift vs. Powershuttle configurations.
- **Global Bulletins:** Official Case technical service bulletins (TSBs) are tracked strictly by serial number ranges.

## 🔍 Where Is It? Model-Specific Plate Locations

Case has utilized several primary locations for their identification plates over the years. Use the guide below based on your machine type.

### 1. Backhoe Loaders (580, 590, 695 Series)
For the modern N-Series and older M-Series backhoes, look in these three spots:
- **Primary Plate:** Located on the **left-hand side of the front frame**, near the steering cylinder or pivot area.
- **Cab Riser:** On many N-Series units, a secondary plate is affixed to the **exterior side of the cab**, near the operator's entry step.
- **ROPS Pillar:** Look for a stamped tag on the rear ROPS (Roll-Over Protective Structure) post.

### 2. Wheel Loaders (521, 621, 721 through 1121 Series)
- **Articulated Joint:** The primary PIN plate is typically found on the **right-hand side of the front frame**, just ahead of the articulated steering joint.
- **Chassis Stamp:** For permanent identification, Case often stamps the serial number directly into the **frame rail near the front right wheel**.

### 3. Skid Steers & Compact Track Loaders (SR, SV, TR, TV Series)
- **Main Frame:** Look on the **right-hand side frame rail**, often protected by the loader arm when in the down position.
- **Seat Deck:** On some B-Series models, the plate is tucked **under the operator's seat** or on the firewall inside the cab.

## 📊 Decoding the Code: Prefix Patterns and 2025 Data

Case serial numbers typically use a specific prefix that indicates the era and factory origin of the machine.

| Prefix Pattern | Common Models | Generation / Era |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **JJG / JAF** | 580K, 580L, 580M | 1980s - Mid 2000s (Legacy) |
| **N / NDM** | 580N, 590N | 2010 - 2022 (N-Series Tier 4) |
| **JAF / SV** | 580SV, 695SV | 2023 - 2025 (New SV-Series) |
| **N / B** | TV370B, TV450B | 2020 - 2025 (B-Series CTLs) |
| **P / EU** | Stage V Models | 2024 - Future (International Specs) |

### 🆕 2025 Update: The SV-Series Launch
The new **Case SV-Series** backhoes (the "Construction King" revival) utilize a revised PIN format. These machines feature heavily updated cabs and "FPT" (Fiat Powertrain) engines. **Warning:** Many parts from the N-Series *look* identical but have different internal tolerances. Always verify the "JAF" or "SV" prefix before ordering.

## 💡 Case Study: The "Interim" Engine Trap

In mid-2024, a fleet owner ordered a complete set of engine filters for three **Case 580N** backhoes, all purchased in the same month.

**The Problem:** Two of the machines were from the end of a "Tier 4 Interim" production run, while the third was the very first of the "Tier 4 Final" block. 
**The Difference:** The Tier 4 Final machine required a completely different crankcase ventilation (CCV) filter and a specialized urea (DEF) filter that the Interim machines did not have.
**The Save:** By cross-referencing the serial numbers, we identified the discrepancy before the filters were shipped. We provided the specific "Filter Kit" for the T4F unit, preventing the customer from tearing down the machine only to find the parts didn't fit.

## 📋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### **Q: Is the PIN the same as the Serial Number?**
In the Case world, "PIN" stands for Product Identification Number and refers to the entire machine. "Serial Number" is often used for individual components like the engine or the bucket.

### **Q: Why does my Case serial number start with "JAF"?**
The "JAF" prefix is common for Case machines built at North American facilities. It is part of the CNH Industrial global tracking system.

### **Q: Can I look up my Case build date for free?**
Yes! Use our tool above or the official **[Case MyCNH](https://www.casece.com/)** portal. Official portals often require an account for detailed build sheets.

### **Q: What if my plate is painted over?**
Use a light solvent or very fine sandpaper on the frame rail near the front right wheel to reveal the stamped chassis number.
