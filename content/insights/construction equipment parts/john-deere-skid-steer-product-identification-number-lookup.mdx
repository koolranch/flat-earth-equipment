This article will comprehensively outline where to find the serial number on both the operator's manual and the machine itself. It will also explain the significance of documentation practices and regular checks, ensuring that you maximize the longevity and utility of your John Deere skid steer. Welcome to your ultimate guide on skid steer serial numbers!





## Where to Find the Serial Number





Identifying the serial number on your John Deere skid steer is crucial for various reasons, including ordering parts, service inquiries, or determining the age of your machine. Here's where you can locate this valuable piece of information across different John Deere equipment:





For smaller John Deere machines, the serial number is typically located on the left side, tucked behind the left support arm. This is often easily visible and accessible. On the other hand, when dealing with larger John Deere machinery, you are more likely to find the serial number on the left side but toward the rear, situated under the left lift arm.





For other types of equipment such as excavators, the serial number can generally be found on the right or left side of the front face of the machine. In the case of telehandlers, the serial number positioning shifts to the right side of the chassis. Remember that John Deere dealers also keep comprehensive sales and service records that include these important serial numbers for your machines.





### In the Operator's Manual





Upon acquiring a John Deere machine, it is important to consult the operator's manual, as it not only guides you in the effective operation and maintenance of the equipment but also provides a dedicated reference section listing the serial number and other vital machine details. It is recommended to fill out the serial number in this manual right at the initial purchase with your dealer's help.





In the event the manual is not on hand, it can often be purchased online containing the necessary operational information. Additionally, such a manual may offer insights into fault codes, an essential aspect of machine diagnostics. Keeping the manual accessible is an indispensable practice for any operator as it acts as a key resource.





### On the Machine Itself





When attempting to locate the product identification number on various John Deere equipment, there are key spots to check based on the type of equipment.





For a John Deere walk-behind lawn mower, the model number is typically located on the deck, right behind the engine. John Deere snow blowers, alternatively, display their model number in yellow letters on the side or on a product identification tag possibly positioned on the back panel or beneath the machine near the scraper bar.





The 17-digit product identification number found on John Deere equipment encodes essential details such as the world code, model identifier, the manufacturing year code, and engine emissions code. Additionally, the engine serial numbers divulge specifics regarding the engine, including factory designation, cylinder count, displacement, and emission level, which are pivotal for choosing the correct parts and ensuring compliance.





### Through Your Dealer





Leaning on the expertise of John Deere dealers is an excellent choice for comprehensive customer parts service, serving a spectrum of customers in agricultural, construction, and lawn care sectors. Through authorized John Deere dealers, one can access engine warranties which typically cover OEM engines for a period of up to 2 years or 2,000 hours.





Furthermore, dealers carry the genuine parts tailored to enhance the performance of John Deere equipment while maintaining emission standards. They are also a reliable resource for retrieving serial numbers necessary for equipment maintenance and part identification. To facilitate part purchases, customers can create a JDParts account linked to their local John Deere dealer, allowing them to view availability and pricing.





When seeking out your John Deere skid steer product identification number, remember that whether it's through your operator's manual, directly on the machine, or with the assistance of a dealer, maintaining a record of this number is a key step in safeguarding one of your most valuable assets.





## Understanding the Serial Number Plate





The serial number plate is a small but mighty label that carries significant information about your John Deere skid steer. Essentially, it acts as the machine's fingerprint, supplying details like the model number, year of manufacture, and a unique serial number that are imperative for the accurate identification of the equipment. Typically, the nine-digit serial number consists of two parts: a four-digit model identification number that represents the specifics of the machine and a five-digit production sequence number that reveals the machine's place in the order of manufacture.





The exact location of the serial number plate can vary depending on the type of equipment you have. On a skid steer, you might find this identifier inside the cab, above the grille, or on the chassis. Understanding the positioning of this plate is crucial since it's your gateway to proper maintenance, correct parts ordering, warranty information, and tracking service history. Skid steer owners should familiarise themselves with the serial number plate's location to ensure efficient service and support from their John Deere dealer.
