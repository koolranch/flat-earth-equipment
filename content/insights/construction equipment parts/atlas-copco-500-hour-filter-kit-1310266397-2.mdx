- Clean the housing: Wipe the inside of the filter housing with a clean cloth to remove any dust or oil residue.This ensures a proper seal when you install the new filter.
- Install the new filter: Take the new filter from the 500 Hour Filter Kit 1310266397 and place it into the housing.Screw the housing back in place securely, making sure it is tight enough to prevent leaks but not overtightened.

## Genuine vs Aftermarket Parts



Choosing between genuine and aftermarket parts for your Atlas Copco compressor can affect your machinery's performance, cost, and warranty. Understanding these differences helps make an informed decision.

### Quality Comparisons

Genuine Manufacturer Kits are designed specifically for Atlas Copco compressors. They meet high standards, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.
