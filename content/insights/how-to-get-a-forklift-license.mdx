# How to Get a Forklift License: Your Complete Step-by-Step Guide for 2025

Getting a forklift license is essential for anyone who wants to operate industrial equipment safely and legally in the workplace. With over 85,000 forklift-related accidents occurring annually in the United States, proper certification isn't just recommended—it's required by OSHA regulations and can significantly boost your career prospects.

**Quick Answer: To get a forklift license, you need to complete OSHA-compliant training that includes both classroom instruction and hands-on evaluation. The process typically takes 1-8 hours and costs between $59-$200.**

## What Is a Forklift License?

Technically, there's no such thing as a "forklift license" issued by the government. What people commonly call a "forklift license" is actually **OSHA forklift operator certification**. This certification proves you've completed required safety training under OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.178.

### Key Facts About Forklift Certification:
- Required by federal law (OSHA) for all forklift operators
- Valid for 3 years before recertification required
- Must be specific to your workplace and equipment type
- Includes both theoretical knowledge and practical skills

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is a forklift license valid at all companies?
No, OSHA requires workplace-specific training. While your knowledge transfers, each employer must conduct their own evaluation of your skills in their specific environment.

### Can I get forklift certified online?
Yes, you can complete the theoretical training portion online. However, OSHA requires your employer to conduct a hands-on practical evaluation at your actual workplace.

### How long is a forklift license good for?
Forklift certification is valid for a maximum of 3 years. However, retraining may be required sooner if you have an accident, switch equipment types, or if performance issues are observed.

### Do I need different licenses for different types of forklifts?

### What happens if I operate a forklift without certification?
Operating without proper certification violates OSHA regulations and can result in:
- Fines for both employee and employer
- Workplace injuries and liability issues
- Termination from employment
- Legal consequences in case of accidents
