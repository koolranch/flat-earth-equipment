<h3>Cabin Filter Access and Replacement</h3>
<p>Accessing the <strong>cabin air filter</strong> in a JCB telehandler typically involves removing a panel or cover in the cab area. </p>
<p>For most models, the filter is located behind the dashboard or under the seat. </p>
<p>Secure the area and ensure the machine is off before starting this task.</p>
<p>Use a <strong><a href="https://flatearthequipment.com/parts/construction-equipment-parts/jcb-parts-by-serial-number/">filter kit</a></strong> designed for your specific model to replace the cabin filter. </p>
<p>These kits often include instructions and the necessary components for a seamless replacement. </p>
