## Operational Considerations for Rental Equipment



When selecting rental equipment for warehouse operations, attention must be paid to specific operational needs such as lift capacity and compliance with safety regulations.


### Equipment Selection by Capacity and Tire Type


Lift Capacity: The primary consideration for warehouse equipment is the lift capacity. 


The capacity needed largely depends on the weight of the goods that will be handled. 


Forklifts, for example, have a forklift capacity plate that indicates the maximum weight it can safely lift. 


Heavy loads require equipment with a higher capacity to ensure operational efficiency and safety.


Tire Type: Equipment tires play a crucial role in how well they perform in different environments. 


Electric and LP (Liquid Propane) forklifts, often used indoors, may have smooth tires that are ideal for flat surfaces. 


For rough or uneven terrain, as found in some outdoor warehouses, choosing forklifts or other rental equipment with rough terrain tires is advised.


### Safety Compliance and OSHA Regulations


OSHA Regulations: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets forth guidelines to ensure workplace safety and health, which includes the operation of warehouse equipment. 


Adhering to OSHA regulations helps prevent accidents and injuries.


- Equipment such as forklifts must be operated by trained personnel.
- Load capacities should never be exceeded, as per OSHA guidelines.
- Safety checks and maintenance of peripherals like tires need to be conducted regularly to prevent malfunctions.



## Warehouse Equipment Rental Costs





Renting warehouse equipment is an essential aspect of managing and transporting materials and inventory efficiently. 


The costs associated with rentals fluctuate based on a range of factors, which include the type of equipment and the duration of the rental period.


### Determining Factors for Rental Pricing


Type of Equipment: The model and capacity of warehouse equipment greatly affect the rental price. 


Forklifts, for example, come in various types such as electric, gas, or diesel, with different lift capacities and tire types. 


A standard 5,000-pound capacity, cushion tire forklift might cost around $150 per day, whereas a larger capacity or different tire forklift could have different pricing.

Capacity: Forklifts designed to lift more weight are typically more expensive. A 6,000 lb. forklift can have different rental costs depending on whether it's an electric, gas, or diesel model.


- 

Rental Duration: Short-term rentals often cost more per day compared to long-term rentals. For compact equipment or smaller forklifts, these costs can add up quickly for day-to-day operations.

Mast Type: The height to which a forklift can raise materials (e.g., a quad mast for heights of 11' to 15'9") influences rental fees.




Condition and Age of Equipment: Newer models with advanced features might be priced higher than older ones.


Location: Availability and local demand can cause rental costs to vary by region.


Rental Company:* Costs can differ from one supplier to another based on the services they offer alongside the rentals.


Transport Costs: Delivering and picking up the rental equipment incurs additional fees which depend on the distance and logistics involved.


Add-ons and Accessories: Additional costs may apply for any extra attachments or accessories needed for specific tasks.


Fuel Type and Consumption: Operational costs like fuel are typically not included in the rental rate and will depend on whether the equipment uses electric, gas, or diesel power.
