<p>When you hear about OSHA forklift training, what&#39;s being discussed is a specific federal law: <strong>29 CFR 1910.178</strong>. This isn&#39;t just a friendly recommendation from the government; it&#39;s a mandatory rule that requires every employer to make sure their forklift operators are properly trained, evaluated, and certified for the job.</p>
<p>The whole point is to stop accidents before they happen by ensuring operators are genuinely competent to handle the specific trucks they&#39;ll be using in their actual work environment.</p>
<h2>What Is the OSHA Forklift Training Standard?</h2>
<p>At its heart, the OSHA forklift standard is a safety framework that puts the responsibility squarely on the employer. It&#39;s more than just ticking off boxes on a training sheet. It’s a legal requirement for companies to certify that their operators are safe and skilled.</p>
<p>Think of it like getting a driver&#39;s license. You can&#39;t just read the DMV handbook and then hit the highway. There&#39;s a formal process involving classroom learning, behind-the-wheel practice, and a final skills test. OSHA&#39;s approach is built on a similar, three-part structure. If any one of these pieces is missing, the training program is incomplete and doesn&#39;t meet federal law.</p>
<p>To stay compliant, OSHA&#39;s training model is built on three core pillars that work together. A program must blend knowledge with real, hands-on skill. Let&#39;s break down what that looks like in a table.</p>

<p>This three-step progression ensures that what&#39;s learned in the classroom is effectively applied in the real world before an operator is ever given the keys.</p>

<p>This simple flow is designed to build true competence, moving an operator from basic knowledge to proven, real-world skill.</p>
<h3>The Employer Is the One Doing the Certifying</h3>
<p>One of the biggest misunderstandings is that OSHA hands out forklift licenses. They don&#39;t. <strong>The employer is the certifying body.</strong> This is a critical point because it means your company is ultimately responsible for creating, running, and documenting a training program that satisfies all of OSHA&#39;s rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The standard’s goal is clear: to ensure every operator is fully prepared for the specific equipment they will use and the specific environmental conditions they will face. Generic, one-size-fits-all training does not satisfy this requirement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These rules aren&#39;t new. The first federal standards were put in place way back on <strong>May 29, 1971</strong>, borrowing from long-established industry safety practices. OSHA beefed up the regulations in <strong>1998</strong>, making the comprehensive training and evaluation process we have today mandatory. This history shows just how long the push has been to cut down on forklift accidents through solid, standardized training.</p>
<p>By getting these core components right, you can build a safer and more efficient workplace. For more guidance, check out our insights on building <a href="https://www.flatearthequipment.com/safety">comprehensive equipment safety programs</a>.</p>
<h2>What Every OSHA Training Program Must Cover</h2>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://cdn.outrank.so/5d03c21f-d46f-4ec4-811a-6a4fa5936936/edc6da60-f178-4d2b-9272-19fea56352e3.jpg" alt="Forklift operator moving pallets in a brightly lit warehouse." /></figure><br>Getting compliant under the <strong>OSHA standard for forklift training</strong> means going way beyond just watching a safety video and taking a quick quiz. OSHA’s rules, specifically <strong>29 CFR 1910.178(l)(3)</strong>, are crystal clear about what an operator needs to know <em>before</em> they can be certified.</p>
<p>The standard breaks training down into three main categories: topics about the truck itself, the specific workplace, and the loads being handled.</p>
<p>Think of it as building a house. You can’t have a sturdy structure without a solid foundation (knowing the truck), strong walls (understanding the work environment), and a good roof (handling loads correctly). If any one of those is weak, the whole thing is at risk of collapsing. That’s exactly how OSHA sees operator training.</p>
<p>This isn’t about rote memorization. It’s about building practical, life-saving knowledge that your operators will use every single day. Let&#39;s dig into the three pillars of a truly compliant training program.</p>
<h3>Mastering the Machine: Truck-Related Topics</h3>
<p>Before anyone can safely drive a forklift, they have to understand the specific machine they’re operating. The training must cover the exact type of powered industrial truck the employee will be using because every model is different—they have their own controls, capacities, and quirks.</p>
<p>It’s just like how a pilot trained on a tiny Cessna isn’t suddenly qualified to fly a Boeing 747. The same logic applies here. An operator who knows a sit-down, counterbalanced forklift inside and out still needs entirely new training before hopping on a narrow-aisle stand-up reach truck.</p>
<p>OSHA mandates that training covers these key truck-related areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Instructions and Warnings:</strong> Knowing what all the labels, decals, and manual instructions for that <em>specific</em> model mean.</li>
<li><strong>Differences from Automobiles:</strong> Forklifts aren&#39;t cars. They steer from the rear, have a completely different center of gravity, and handle like nothing else on four wheels.</li>
<li><strong>Controls and Instrumentation:</strong> The operator must know every lever, button, gauge, and horn by heart. No hesitation.</li>
<li><strong>Engine or Motor Operation:</strong> Understanding the power source—whether it’s gas, propane, or electric—is critical for safe startup, shutdown, and refueling or recharging.</li>
<li><strong>Steering and Maneuvering:</strong> This requires hands-on practice, covering everything from basic turns to navigating the actual workspace.</li>
<li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Learning to work around the blind spots created by the mast, the load itself, and the overhead guard.</li>
<li><strong>Fork and Attachment Adaptation:</strong> If you use special attachments like clamps or rotators, operators need training on how they change the truck’s stability and capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Vehicle Capacity and Stability:</strong> This is a big one. It’s all about the &quot;stability triangle&quot; and understanding how load weight, height, and position can lead to a tip-over.</li>
<li><strong>Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance:</strong> Every operator must be trained to conduct a thorough pre-use inspection and know exactly what to do if they find a problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Navigating the Environment: Workplace-Related Topics</h3>
<p>You can have the best operator and a perfectly maintained forklift, but accidents can still happen if they don&#39;t understand their environment. That’s why the <strong>OSHA standard for forklift training</strong> absolutely requires site-specific instruction. Every facility has its own unique set of hazards.</p>
<p>For instance, an operator working on a sloped loading dock faces totally different challenges than one on a perfectly flat, polished warehouse floor. The training has to prepare them for the real-world conditions they’ll see every shift.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to OSHA, the training must be tailored to the specific conditions of the workplace. This means a generic online course, by itself, is never enough for full compliance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key workplace topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surface Conditions:</strong> Knowing how to operate on concrete, asphalt, dirt, or any other surface at your facility.</li>
<li><strong>Ramps and Slopes:</strong> Proper procedures for driving on inclines—always keeping the load pointed uphill.</li>
<li><strong>Hazardous Locations:</strong> Identifying areas with poor ventilation where carbon monoxide could build up, or places with flammable materials.</li>
<li><strong>Pedestrian Traffic:</strong> Often the biggest hazard in any workplace. Training must cover how to handle intersections, when to use the horn, and how to keep a safe distance from people on foot.</li>
<li><strong>Narrow Aisles:</strong> Maneuvering in tight spaces takes serious skill to avoid hitting racking, product, or people.</li>
<li><strong>Closed Environments:</strong> Special rules for working inside trailers, rail cars, or other confined areas.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Managing the Job: Load-Related Topics</h3>
<p>Finally, the training must focus on the work itself—the safe and efficient handling of loads. This is more than just moving a pallet from point A to point B. It’s about knowing how a load&#39;s characteristics impact the forklift’s stability and safety.</p>
<p>A tall, wobbly load of boxes requires a completely different approach than a dense, compact pallet of concrete bags. Operators must be trained to size up every load and adjust their technique. For a deeper dive, our guide on <a href="https://www.flatearthequipment.com/safety/forklift">forklift safety procedures</a> offers more context on these essential practices.</p>
<p>The mandatory load-related topics are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stacking and Unstacking:</strong> The right way to place and retrieve loads from racking or block stacks without causing a collapse.</li>
<li><strong>Load Manipulation and Stability:</strong> How to pick up a load squarely, carry it low to the ground, and tilt the mast back to keep it stable while moving.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding Load Capacity:</strong> Knowing how to read the forklift&#39;s data plate to ensure a load&#39;s weight and dimensions don&#39;t exceed the truck&#39;s rated capacity.</li>
</ul>
<p>By making sure your program thoroughly covers these three areas—the truck, the workplace, and the load—you’ll build a training program that isn&#39;t just compliant, but genuinely effective at keeping your people safe.</p>
<h2>The Critical Difference Between Training and Evaluation</h2>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://cdn.outrank.so/5d03c21f-d46f-4ec4-811a-6a4fa5936936/003cc21a-ab60-4829-bebd-bf5de15b82a1.jpg" alt="Forklift operator being observed by a supervisor with a clipboard in a warehouse setting." /></figure><br>This is where a lot of companies get tripped up. It’s one of the easiest ways to fall out of compliance with the <strong>OSHA standard for forklift training</strong> without even realizing it. They mix up teaching someone <em>how</em> to do something with proving they <em>can</em> do it safely. OSHA draws a very clear line in the sand between <strong>training</strong> and <strong>evaluation</strong>, and blurring that line creates serious safety gaps and opens you up to some hefty fines.</p>
<p>Think about getting your driver&#39;s license. The <strong>training</strong> is all the time you spent in a classroom learning the rules of the road, and then driving around an empty parking lot with an instructor. That&#39;s the learning phase.</p>
<p>The <strong>evaluation</strong>, on the other hand, is the nerve-wracking road test. It’s when the DMV examiner gets in the car and watches you merge into real traffic, parallel park on a busy street, and handle actual driving situations. One part is learning, the other is proving. OSHA sees forklift certification the exact same way.</p>
<h3>What Is Formal Training</h3>
<p>Formal training is step one—it’s the knowledge-building phase. This is where your operators learn the theory behind the machine, the specific hazards in your workplace, and the physics of managing a heavy load. It&#39;s the &quot;classroom&quot; part of the process, even if the classroom is online.</p>
<p>This can be handled in a few different ways, all of which are perfectly acceptable to OSHA:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interactive Online Modules:</strong> These are great for letting operators learn at their own pace. Good courses include quizzes and checks along the way to make sure the information is sinking in.</li>
<li><strong>Instructor-Led Lectures:</strong> A classic for a reason. An in-person expert can answer questions on the spot and tailor the discussion to your facility&#39;s specific challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Videos and Handouts:</strong> Solid resources that provide visual examples and serve as a reference guide later on.</li>
</ul>
<p>But here’s the key: finishing this part only means the operator has been <em>taught</em>. It absolutely does not mean they are certified.</p>
<h3>What Is a Proper Hands-On Evaluation</h3>
<p>The performance evaluation is the final exam and the only thing that truly certifies an operator. According to OSHA, this isn’t just a quick check to see if they can drive in a straight line in an empty corner of the warehouse.</p>
<p>The evaluation has to be a formal observation of the trainee operating the forklift in their <em>actual work environment</em>, doing the <em>actual tasks</em> they’ll be responsible for every day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The entire point of the hands-on evaluation is to bridge the gap between knowing and doing. It confirms that the operator can apply everything they learned in the classroom to the chaos and unpredictability of the real world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A qualified evaluator—someone who really knows their stuff—must watch the operator navigate the facility. This means dealing with your specific racking, interacting with pedestrian traffic, loading and unloading trucks at your dock, and maneuvering through the unique quirks of your layout. The evaluator is there to verify that the theory has turned into safe, competent action.</p>
<h3>Who Is Qualified to Evaluate Operators</h3>
<p>OSHA is pretty specific here. The person signing off on an operator’s skills can’t just be a random manager. A qualified trainer or evaluator needs the knowledge, training, and experience to teach the material <em>and</em> accurately judge someone’s ability behind the wheel. They have to be sharp enough to spot subtle bad habits, not just obvious mistakes.</p>
<p>This person could be an experienced supervisor, a safety consultant you bring in, or a dedicated in-house trainer. Their job title doesn&#39;t matter nearly as much as their proven expertise. Their signature on that evaluation form is what makes it official. Without that documented, hands-on assessment, your training program is incomplete, and your operators simply aren&#39;t certified in OSHA&#39;s eyes.</p>
<h2>Forklift Certification and Documentation Rules</h2>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://cdn.outrank.so/5d03c21f-d46f-4ec4-811a-6a4fa5936936/86030443-cb8f-4937-b0fb-36bfa2279fa8.jpg" alt="A close-up of a forklift operator&#39;s official certification card being held up." /></figure></p>
<p>Let’s bust one of the biggest myths in the industry right now: OSHA does not hand out forklift licenses. Not a single one. The responsibility for certifying an operator as competent and safe to use your equipment falls <strong>100% on you</strong>, the employer.</p>
<p>This makes your internal documentation process a cornerstone of your compliance with the <strong>OSHA standard for forklift training</strong>. You are, in effect, the DMV for your own worksite. When you sign off on that certification, you are legally attesting that the operator has passed all the necessary training and evaluation for your specific trucks, in your specific facility. It’s a huge responsibility, and your records had better be ready to back it up.</p>
<h3>Your Certification Record Checklist</h3>
<p>When an OSHA compliance officer shows up, they aren&#39;t looking for a generic certificate printed from a website. They want to see <em>your</em> records, proving that a specific employee is qualified to operate a specific truck at your site. That piece of paper is your proof of due diligence.</p>
<p>It’s one of the first things an investigator will ask for during an inspection, and it needs to be perfect. Think of it as the final, official stamp of approval that says you&#39;ve done everything required to put a safe operator behind the wheel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to <strong>29 CFR 1910.178(l)(6)</strong>, the written certification record must contain the name of the operator, the date of the training, the date of the evaluation, and the identity of the person(s) performing the training or evaluation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn’t just paperwork—it’s your legal defense. To make sure you’ve got all your bases covered, here’s a quick checklist for what every certification document needs.</p>
<h3>OSHA Forklift Certification Record Checklist</h3>
<p>This table breaks down the essential elements your certification records must include to be compliant. Missing any one of these can lead to a citation.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Required Element</th>
<th align="left">Purpose</th>
<th align="left">Common Mistake</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Operator&#39;s Name</strong></td>
<td align="left">Clearly identifies the certified individual.</td>
<td align="left">Using nicknames or incomplete names. The name must match official employee records.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Date of Training</strong></td>

<td align="left">Names the qualified person who observed and signed off on their competence.</td>
<td align="left">Leaving this blank or just writing &quot;Supervisor.&quot; Use the full name and title.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Having these four elements clearly documented and on file for every operator is non-negotiable.</p>
<h3>Why Previous Certifications Don&#39;t Transfer</h3>
<p>Here’s another common trip-up: a new hire shows up with a forklift certification from their last job. Can they start driving for you today? The answer is a hard <strong>no</strong>.</p>
<p>A forklift certification isn&#39;t a universal passport. It&#39;s tied to the specific employer, equipment, and environment where it was issued. The hazards at your facility—from your specific rack heights and aisle widths to the types of loads you move—are unique.</p>
<p>Even if you hire a 20-year veteran, you are still required to conduct your own hands-on performance evaluation. You have to personally verify their skills are a match for <em>your</em> operation before you certify them under your company’s name. This site-specific requirement is a core principle of the OSHA standard. While prior experience is great, it doesn’t let you off the hook.</p>
<p>And remember, some states have their own, stricter rules. For a deeper dive into how local regulations can add another layer to federal law, check out these <a href="https://www.flatearthequipment.com/safety/forklift/ca">California forklift safety standards</a>. Ultimately, you own the certification, which means you must own the entire process that backs it up.</p>
<h2>When Are You Required to Retrain Operators?</h2>
<p>A forklift certification isn&#39;t a one-and-done deal. It’s a credential that needs to be maintained to stay valid under the <strong>OSHA standard for forklift training</strong>. Think of it like a pilot&#39;s license—you don’t just pass a test once and get to fly for life. Pilots have recurrent training and check-rides to keep their skills sharp, and OSHA expects the same from forklift operators.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about bureaucracy; it’s about fighting complacency. An operator who was a pro a year ago can still develop bad habits or struggle with new challenges in the warehouse. That&#39;s why OSHA laid out specific triggers that legally require retraining and re-evaluation to keep everyone safe.</p>
<h3>The Three-Year Performance Review</h3>
<p>The simplest rule to remember is the calendar. OSHA requires that every forklift operator&#39;s performance is formally evaluated at least once every <strong>three years</strong>. This is the absolute longest you can go between formal evaluations.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t just about checking a box. It’s a hands-on assessment where a qualified person watches the operator do their normal job in their usual work environment. The whole point is to confirm their skills are still up to par and they haven&#39;t started cutting corners. If the evaluation shows any problems, retraining is mandatory before they can be certified again.</p>
<h3>Performance Issues That Demand Immediate Action</h3>
<p>The three-year rule is just the baseline. Certain events trigger an immediate need for retraining, no matter how recent the last certification was. When a clear problem pops up, you can&#39;t wait for a scheduled review.</p>
<p>OSHA is very clear that retraining is mandatory if an operator:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is involved in an accident or a near-miss.</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a small bump into a rack or a close call with a coworker. Any incident is a red flag that there’s a gap in the operator&#39;s skill or judgment that needs to be fixed right away.</li>
<li><strong>Is seen operating the truck unsafely.</strong> This could be anything from speeding and taking turns too fast to trying to lift a wobbly, unstable load. If a supervisor spots reckless driving, that’s a direct signal that retraining is necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Fails an evaluation or performance check.</strong> During the three-year review or any other spot-check, if the operator can&#39;t perform a task safely or correctly, they must be retrained on that specific skill.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of these triggers as your forklift safety program&#39;s alarm system. An accident or unsafe act is a loud warning that the operator&#39;s current training isn&#39;t getting the job done anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Changes in the Workplace or Equipment</h3>
<p>The final set of triggers is all about change. The entire <strong>OSHA standard for forklift training</strong> is built around being competent on specific equipment in a specific environment. If you change either of those key variables, the old training might not apply anymore.</p>
<p>Common changes that require retraining include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moving to a different type of truck.</strong> An operator certified on a sit-down, counterbalanced forklift isn&#39;t automatically qualified to jump on a stand-up reach truck or an order picker. Each machine is different and requires its own training and evaluation.</li>
<li><strong>Introducing new workplace conditions.</strong> Let&#39;s say you install new racking that makes the aisles narrower. Your operators need to be retrained to navigate those tighter spaces safely. The same goes for adding a sloped loading dock or changing pedestrian traffic patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Adding a new attachment.</strong> If you put a new attachment on a forklift, like a drum clamp or a carton clamp, the operator has to be trained on it. They need to understand how it changes the truck&#39;s stability, capacity, and overall handling.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules aren&#39;t meant to be punishments. They are common-sense, proactive steps to make sure every single operator has the right skills for their specific job, every single day.</p>
<h2>Common Questions About Forklift Training Standards</h2>
<iframe width="100%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_e7byzNTLI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Navigating the details of the <strong>OSHA standard for forklift training</strong> can feel like trying to read a complicated map without a legend. Even when you think you have a handle on the main rules, real-world questions always pop up.</p>
<p>Most employers and operators run into the same handful of issues when they try to put a compliant training program into practice. This section is all about giving you clear, direct answers to those common sticking points, helping you translate the official jargon into actions you can actually use.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s clear up some of the most frequently asked questions about forklift certification, online training, language barriers, and who&#39;s qualified to be a trainer.</p>
<h3>Can Forklift Training Be Done Completely Online?</h3>
<p>This is probably the biggest point of confusion out there, and the answer is a hard <strong>no</strong>. While online courses are a great—and very popular—way to cover the formal instruction (the &quot;classroom&quot; part), they only satisfy one of OSHA&#39;s three required pieces of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Think of it like getting a driver&#39;s license. You wouldn&#39;t expect to be handed the keys after just reading the DMV handbook and passing an online quiz. You might know the rules, but you have zero experience behind the wheel. OSHA sees forklift training the exact same way.</p>
<p>An online-only certificate just proves you passed a knowledge test. It doesn&#39;t prove you can safely handle a multi-ton piece of machinery in a busy workplace.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be fully compliant, your program <strong>must</strong> include all three parts: formal instruction (which can be online), hands-on practical training, and a final, in-person evaluation of the operator&#39;s skills in their actual work environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A certificate from an online-only course is not a valid OSHA certification. It&#39;s an important first step, but it&#39;s not the finish line. Without the hands-on practice and final workplace evaluation, an operator is not legally certified to drive a forklift.</p>
<h3>Does All Forklift Training Have To Be in English?</h3>
<p>Not at all. In fact, if you force English-only training on a team that isn&#39;t fluent, you&#39;re actually violating OSHA&#39;s requirements. The whole point of the standard is that training has to be delivered in a language and format that employees can <strong>fully understand</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have operators who are more comfortable with Spanish, Vietnamese, or any other language, you are required to provide training they can comprehend. It’s not just about giving them information; it’s about making sure they <em>get it</em>. Critical concepts like the stability triangle or safety warnings are too important to get lost in translation.</p>
<p>When you provide training in an employee&#39;s native language, you ensure they can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask questions</strong> without feeling held back by a language barrier.</li>
<li><strong>Truly grasp the safety concepts</strong> that protect them and everyone around them.</li>
<li><strong>Actually engage with the material</strong> instead of just nodding along to something they don&#39;t understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day, making an operator sit through training they can&#39;t understand is the same as providing no training at all. It doesn&#39;t make them safer, and it leaves the employer totally out of compliance.</p>
<h3>How Long Is a Forklift Certification Valid?</h3>
<p>The simple answer is that an operator&#39;s performance has to be formally evaluated at least once <strong>every three years</strong>. That&#39;s the longest you can go between certifications.</p>
<p>But it’s a huge mistake to just circle a date on the calendar three years from now and forget about it. That three-year mark is just the deadline for a routine check-in when everything is going perfectly. The <strong>OSHA standard for forklift training</strong> actually has several triggers that demand immediate retraining and another evaluation, no matter how recent the last certification was.</p>
<p>These triggers are a built-in safety net. An operator needs to be retrained and re-evaluated well before the three-year mark if they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Involved in an accident or even a near-miss.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Seen operating the forklift in an unsafe way.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Assigned to drive a different type of forklift.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Working in an environment that has changed significantly</strong> (like new racking or narrower aisles).</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of the three-year evaluation as your scheduled maintenance. These other triggers are the unscheduled repairs needed to keep your safety program running properly.</p>
<h3>Who Is Qualified To Be a Forklift Trainer?</h3>
<p>This is another area where OSHA focuses on real-world ability, not a specific piece of paper. There&#39;s no official &quot;forklift trainer certification&quot; that OSHA issues. The standard is all about performance.</p>
<p>OSHA simply says a trainer must have the right <strong>knowledge, training, and experience</strong> to teach operators and evaluate their skills effectively. It all comes down to proven expertise.</p>
<p>So, who fits that bill? A qualified trainer could be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A veteran in-house supervisor</strong> who has driven forklifts for years and knows your facility&#39;s specific hazards inside and out.</li>
<li><strong>An external safety consultant</strong> who specializes in powered industrial truck training.</li>
<li><strong>A dedicated safety manager</strong> in your company who has received specialized training on the topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key is that the person doing the training—and especially the person conducting the final hands-on evaluation—must be able to prove they know their stuff. They need to understand the equipment, the regulations, and have the skill to accurately judge an operator&#39;s performance in a real-world setting. The responsibility falls on the employer to make sure their trainer is truly competent.</p>
