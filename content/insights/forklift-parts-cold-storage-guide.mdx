<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding the Impact of Cold on Forklift Operations</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cold temperatures can severely affect forklift operations. Batteries may lose capacity more quickly, leading to reduced operational time and increased downtime for charging. Hydraulic fluids can thicken at low temperatures, making machinery harder to operate and potentially causing damage. Mechanical components are also at risk, as cold can make metals more brittle and lubricants less effective, increasing wear and tear. Addressing these issues with the right forklift parts is essential for maintaining productivity and extending the lifespan of your equipment.</p>
