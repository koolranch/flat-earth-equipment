# Forklift Forks: Essential Guidelines for Selection and Maintenance

Forklift forks are critical components that directly impact the safety and efficiency of your material handling operations. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about selecting, maintaining, and inspecting forklift forks.

## Understanding Fork Classes

### ITA Fork Classifications
1. **Class I**
   - Light-duty applications
   - Load capacity: Up to 2,000 lbs
   - Common in retail and small warehouses

2. **Class II**
   - Medium-duty applications
   - Load capacity: 2,000-5,500 lbs
   - Standard warehouse operations

3. **Class III**
   - Heavy-duty applications
   - Load capacity: 5,500-11,000 lbs
   - Industrial and manufacturing use

4. **Class IV**
   - Extra heavy-duty applications
   - Load capacity: 11,000-17,600 lbs
   - Heavy industrial operations

5. **Class V**
   - Ultra heavy-duty applications
   - Load capacity: 17,600-24,200 lbs
   - Specialized industrial use

## Fork Types and Applications

### Standard Forks
- General purpose use
- Even thickness throughout
- Most common type
- Suitable for most applications

### Tapered Forks
- Thinner at the tip
- Easier entry into pallets
- Reduced material damage
- Better for fragile loads

### Block Forks
- Extra thick construction
- Heavy-duty applications
- High load capacity
- Industrial use

### Drum Forks
- Curved design
- Specialized for drum handling
- Improved stability
- Chemical industry use

## Inspection Guidelines

### Daily Inspection Checklist
- [ ] Check for visible cracks
- [ ] Measure fork thickness
- [ ] Inspect fork tips
- [ ] Verify fork alignment
- [ ] Check mounting hardware

### Weekly Inspection
- [ ] Detailed thickness measurement
- [ ] Fork length verification
- [ ] Surface condition check
- [ ] Mounting system inspection
- [ ] Load backrest examination

### Monthly Inspection
- [ ] Professional measurement
- [ ] Load capacity verification
- [ ] Complete system check
- [ ] Documentation review
- [ ] Maintenance planning

## Wear Limits and Replacement

### Critical Measurements
1. **Fork Thickness**
   - Measure at heel
   - Measure at center
   - Measure at tip
   - Compare to specifications

2. **Fork Length**
   - Check overall length
   - Verify tip condition
   - Measure wear at tip
   - Document measurements

### Replacement Criteria
- Thickness below 90% of original
- Visible cracks or damage
- Excessive tip wear
- Bent or twisted forks
- Manufacturer's recommended interval

## Load Handling Guidelines

### Safe Load Practices
1. **Load Distribution**
   - Center load on forks
   - Maintain even weight distribution
   - Use proper fork spacing
   - Verify load stability

2. **Load Capacity**
   - Never exceed rated capacity
   - Consider load center
   - Account for attachments
   - Follow manufacturer guidelines

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance
