### Stability triangle — the line you don't cross
Keep the combined center of gravity inside the triangle formed by the front axle and the steer axle midpoint.

### Capacity changes with load center
The data plate capacity applies at a specific load center. Moving the load forward reduces allowable weight.

<MicroQuiz id="m3-stability" items={[
  { q:'What happens when the load center increases?', choices:['Capacity increases','Capacity decreases','No change','Truck speeds up'], correct:1 },
  { q:'Tip-overs occur when the combined center of gravity…', choices:['Stays within triangle','Crosses outside the triangle','Is near mast','Is low'], correct:1 }
]} />
