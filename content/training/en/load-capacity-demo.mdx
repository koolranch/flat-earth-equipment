# Load Capacity Training

Understanding load capacity is critical for safe forklift operation.

<Objectives>
- Learn how load center affects capacity
- Practice capacity calculations
- Understand PASS/CAUTION/FAIL states
</Objectives>

## Key Concepts

The farther the load center extends from the forks, the less weight the forklift can safely carry.

<Callout type="warn">
Always check the forklift's data plate for rated capacity and load center specifications.
</Callout>

## Interactive Calculator

Try adjusting the values below to see how capacity changes:

## Safety Guidelines

<Checklist items={[
  'Check data plate before lifting any load',
  'Measure actual load center distance', 
  'Never exceed calculated allowable capacity',
  'Use CAUTION zone as warning threshold'
]} />

## Quick Knowledge Check

<MicroQuiz id="load-capacity-basics" items={[
  {
    q: "What happens to allowable capacity as load center increases?",
    choices: ["Increases", "Decreases", "Stays the same", "Doubles"],
    correct: 1,
    explain: "Capacity decreases as load center increases - this is fundamental to forklift physics."
  },
  {
    q: "What should you do if the calculator shows FAIL state?",
    choices: ["Proceed carefully", "Reduce load weight or move load closer", "Ignore the warning", "Increase speed"],
    correct: 1,
    explain: "Either reduce the load weight or move it closer to the forks to get back into safe operating range."
  }
