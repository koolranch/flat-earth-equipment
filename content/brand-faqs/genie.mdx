Q: Where is the Genie serial/VIN label?
A: Often on the chassis near ground controls or inside the platform area; scissors may place it on the entry side.

Q: Do Genie codes differ by model?
A: Some codes are platform-wide; others vary by controller. Filter by model in the Fault tab.

Q: Why does my GS-1930 show low-voltage codes after charging?
A: Load-test the pack; weak cells can drop under drive demand even when freshly charged.
