### Serial Plate Locations
Common locations include the chassis near the ground controls, inside the platform control box cover, or on the frame near the steer axle. Cross-check any stamped frame number.

### Decoding Basics
JLG labels typically include model, serial, and date/build identifiers. Use the model to constrain parts and the serial to match running changes.

### Quick Fault Workflow
1. Verify battery voltage and main contactor operation.
2. Read active/stored codes (see Fault tab).
3. Inspect harnesses at high-flex points (platform, boom junctions).

### Safety Notes
- Chock wheels and use proper lockout/tagout.
- Never bypass interlocks for testing without controls in place.
