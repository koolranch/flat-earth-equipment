### Serial Plate Locations
Common locations include the chassis near operator controls, frame rails, or by the counterweight. Cross-check any stamped frame ID.

### Decoding Basics
The serial/pin is used with the model to resolve running changes. Use our Serial tab to narrow by family and check mid-series breaks.

### Quick Fault Workflow
1. Verify system voltage and main contactor operation.
2. Retrieve active/stored codes (see Fault Codes tab).
3. Inspect high-flex harness points and sensor references.

### Safety Notes
- Follow lockout/tagout and support raised components.
- Confirm OEM procedures for lifting and hydraulics.
