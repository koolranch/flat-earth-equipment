Welcome to Module 1: Pre-Operation Inspection.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Before operating any forklift, you must complete a thorough inspection.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This ensures the safety of yourself and everyone around you.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's start by examining the proper sequence for inspection.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
First, put on all required personal protective equipment.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This includes your hard hat, safety vest, and safety glasses.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Next, ensure the parking brake is set before beginning.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Lower the forks completely to the floor.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now you're ready to begin the systematic inspection process.
