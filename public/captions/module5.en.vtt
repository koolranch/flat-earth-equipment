Module 5: Final Review and Certification Requirements.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Congratulations on completing the forklift safety training modules.
Let's review the key points covered in this course.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
OSHA requires all forklift operators to be trained and certified
before operating powered industrial trucks.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Operators must be at least 18 years old and complete
both classroom and practical evaluations.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Key safety practices include: conducting pre-operation inspections,
following speed limits, and maintaining safe distances.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Always travel with forks low and tilted back,
sound your horn at blind spots, and never exceed load capacity.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Your certification is valid for three years, but refresher training
is required after accidents or observed unsafe operation.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Remember that each workplace may have specific rules
and procedures beyond OSHA requirements.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
After passing this course, your employer will conduct
a practical evaluation of your operating skills.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Thank you for your commitment to safety.
Operating forklifts safely protects you and your coworkers.
