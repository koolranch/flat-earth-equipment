Eight-Point Inspection - Full Transcript

Eight points, every time: tires, forks, chains, horn, lights, hydraulics, leaks, data plate. If it's not right, don't drive it.

The eight-point inspection is your systematic check of critical forklift components. This inspection must be completed every shift, every time, no exceptions.

The Eight Points:

1. Tires and Wheels
   - Check for proper inflation
   - Look for cuts, bulges, or excessive wear
   - Ensure wheels are properly secured

2. Forks and Carriage
   - Inspect for cracks, bends, or excessive wear
   - Check fork positioning and locking mechanisms
   - Verify carriage moves smoothly

3. Lift Chains and Mast
   - Look for stretched, kinked, or damaged links
   - Check chain anchors and attachments
   - Inspect mast for damage or wear

4. Horn and Warning Devices
   - Test horn functionality
   - Check backup alarms if equipped
   - Verify all warning lights work

5. Lights and Visibility
   - Test headlights and work lights
   - Check mirrors and visibility aids
   - Ensure all lights are clean and functional

6. Hydraulic System
   - Check fluid levels in reservoir
   - Inspect hoses and connections
   - Test lift and tilt functions

7. Leaks and Fluids
   - Look under the truck for any leaks
   - Check engine oil, coolant, brake fluid
   - Inspect for hydraulic fluid leaks

8. Data Plate and Documentation
   - Verify data plate is readable and attached
   - Check that capacity ratings are visible
   - Ensure inspection records are current

If ANY point fails inspection, tag the forklift out of service immediately. No shortcuts, no exceptions.
