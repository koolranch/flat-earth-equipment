Pre-Operation Inspection - Full Transcript

Pre-operation means ready to work: PPE on, forks down, brake set. Do your 8-point inspection before moving. If something's off, tag it out.

Before you even think about starting that forklift, you need to be properly prepared. This isn't optional - it's required by OSHA and it's what keeps you and everyone around you safe.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):
- Hard hat - protects from falling objects
- Safety vest - makes you visible to other operators
- Safety glasses - shields your eyes from debris
- Steel-toed boots - protects your feet

Pre-Operation Setup:
1. Parking brake must be set before you begin
2. Forks completely lowered to the floor
3. Mast tilted back to neutral position
4. Key off during inspection

The inspection process is systematic and thorough. Never skip steps, never rush through it. A few minutes of inspection can prevent hours of downtime or worse - serious injury.

If you find any issues during inspection:
- Tag the forklift out of service immediately
- Report the issue to your supervisor
- Do not operate until repairs are completed
- Document what you found

Remember: No load is worth risking safety. When in doubt, don't operate.
