Module 2: Operating Procedures and Load Handling.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Safe forklift operation begins with proper pre-operation inspection.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Before each shift, operators must complete a thorough
inspection of their equipment.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Check the forks for cracks, bends, or excessive wear.
Inspect the mast chains for proper tension and lubrication.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Test all controls including lift, tilt, and steering functions.
Ensure brakes and horn are working properly.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
When traveling with a load, always keep the forks
tilted back slightly and as low as possible.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The maximum safe travel speed in work areas is 5 mph.
Reduce speed when turning or on wet surfaces.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Understanding the stability triangle is crucial for safe operation.
This is the area between the forklift's three support points.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Never exceed the rated load capacity of your forklift.
Check the data plate for specific weight limits.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Remember: A loaded forklift handles very differently than an empty one.
Always adjust your operating style accordingly.
