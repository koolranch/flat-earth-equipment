Module 3: Workplace Safety and Hazard Recognition.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Workplace safety involves both equipment operation
and environmental awareness.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Statistics show that 36% of forklift accidents
involve pedestrians in the workplace.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Always sound your horn at intersections, blind spots,
and when entering or exiting buildings.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Maintain a safe distance of at least three truck lengths
from other forklifts during operation.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Be aware of overhead hazards including low clearances,
pipes, and electrical lines.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Never allow passengers on your forklift unless
it's equipped with a designated passenger seat.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Watch for floor hazards such as oil spills, debris,
uneven surfaces, and dock edges.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
When working near loading docks, ensure trailer wheels
are chocked and dock plates are secure.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Remember: Safety is everyone's responsibility.
Report hazards immediately to prevent accidents.
