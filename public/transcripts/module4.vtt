Module 4: Advanced Safety Topics and Emergency Procedures.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In this module, we'll cover advanced safety considerations
and emergency response procedures.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
First, let's discuss load stability and center of gravity.
Every load has a center of gravity that affects forklift stability.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
When the combined center of gravity moves outside
the stability triangle, a tip-over can occur.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In case of a tip-over, never jump from the forklift.
Stay seated, grip the wheel, and lean away from the fall.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
For fire emergencies, know the location of fire extinguishers
and emergency exits in your workplace.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If your forklift catches fire, immediately shut off the engine,
evacuate, and alert others in the area.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Regular maintenance is crucial for preventing emergencies.
Report any unusual sounds, leaks, or handling issues immediately.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Remember to document all incidents and near-misses.
This helps prevent future accidents.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Safety is an ongoing commitment that requires
constant vigilance and continuous learning.
