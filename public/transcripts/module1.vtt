Welcome to Module 1: Introduction to Forklift Safety.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In this module, we'll cover the basics of forklift operation
and OSHA safety requirements.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Forklifts are powerful industrial vehicles that require
proper training and certification to operate safely.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.178 covers all requirements
for powered industrial truck operations.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's begin by understanding the key components
of a forklift and their functions.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The mast is the vertical assembly that raises and lowers the load.
The forks are the horizontal prongs that support the load.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The counterweight at the rear balances the load being lifted.
Understanding these components is essential for safe operation.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Remember: Only certified operators who are at least 18 years old
are permitted to operate a forklift.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Throughout this training, we'll cover pre-operation inspections,
safe operating procedures, and hazard recognition.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
By the end of this module, you'll understand the fundamental
safety principles that every forklift operator must follow.
