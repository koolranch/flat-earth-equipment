# Module 2: Daily Forklift Inspection Checklist  
_Flat Earth Equipment • Cheyenne, WY_

---

## Importance of Inspections
Daily checks detect leaks, tire damage, or chain wear **before** failure. OSHA requires the truck be **examined before being placed in service**.

> **CFR 1910.178(q)(7)** – "Industrial trucks shall be examined before being placed in service … any defects shall be immediately reported and corrected."

## 8-Point Visual Inspection

| # | Item | What to look for | Action if Defective |
|---|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Tires** | Cuts, 25% wear, inflation | Check pressure, report excessive wear |
| 2 | **Forks** | Cracks, 10% heel wear, straightness | Tag out immediately if cracked |
| 3 | **Mast chains** | Dry links, kinks, 2+ broken links | Lubricate or tag out if damaged |
| 4 | **Hydraulics** | Oil on cylinder rods, leaks | Clean and monitor, tag if leaking |
| 5 | **Battery** | Corrosion, loose caps, electrolyte level | Clean terminals, check connections |
| 6 | **Overhead guard** | Bent posts, cracked welds | Tag out - structural integrity critical |
| 7 | **Seat-belt** | Frayed webbing, latch function | Replace if damaged - required for operation |
| 8 | **Data plate** | Present, legible capacity info | Clean or replace if unreadable |

:::warning
**Critical Items:** Forks, overhead guard, and hydraulic leaks require immediate tag-out. Never operate with these defects.

## Detailed Inspection Points

### 1. Tire Inspection
- **Tread Depth:** Minimum 1/16" remaining
- **Sidewall Damage:** No cuts deeper than 1/4"
- **Inflation:** Check against manufacturer specs
- **Wear Pattern:** Even wear indicates proper alignment

### 2. Fork Inspection  
- **Heel Wear:** Max 10% of original thickness
- **Cracks:** Any visible crack = immediate tag-out
- **Straightness:** Forks must be parallel and level
- **Mounting:** Secure to carriage, no play

### 3. Mast Chain Inspection
- **Lubrication:** Chains should be properly oiled
- **Wear:** Look for elongated or twisted links  
- **Broken Links:** 2 or more = immediate replacement
- **Tension:** Proper tension per manufacturer specs

### 4. Hydraulic System
- **Cylinder Rods:** Clean, no scoring or pitting
- **Hoses:** No cracks, abrasion, or bulging
- **Fittings:** Tight connections, no leaks
- **Fluid Level:** Check reservoir when lowered

## 3-Point Operational Check

### Functional Tests Required
1. **Horn & Backup Alarm** – Loud, continuous, audible throughout work area
2. **Lights & Strobe** – All illuminate properly, no flickering or dim bulbs  
3. **Service Brake** – Stop within one truck length at normal speed

### Additional Operational Tests
- **Steering** - No binding, returns to center
- **Lift/Lower** - Smooth operation, no jerking
- **Tilt** - Forward and back tilt functions
