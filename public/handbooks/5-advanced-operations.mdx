# Module 5: Shutdown, Charging & Parking Best Practices  
_Flat Earth Equipment • Cheyenne, WY_

---

## End-of-Shift Steps

**The proper shutdown sequence begins with:**

1. **Neutral** – direction lever to neutral (FIRST STEP)
2. **Parking brake** – set firmly and completely
3. **Forks fully down** – flat on ground level
4. **Key off** – remove key from ignition
5. **Plug charger** (electric) or refuel (LP gas)
6. **Wheel chock** – at downhill tire if on slope

:::warning
**Critical Rule:** ALWAYS shift to neutral first. This prevents runaway if parking brake fails during shutdown sequence.

## Battery Charging PPE

### Required Personal Protective Equipment

| PPE Item | Why Required | OSHA Standard |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Rubber insulating gloves** | Electrical protection | 29 CFR 1910.137 |
| **Face shield** | Acid splash protection | 29 CFR 1910.133 |
| **Nitrile gloves** | Chemical burn prevention | 29 CFR 1910.138 |
| **Acid-resistant apron** | Clothing protection | 29 CFR 1910.132 |

> **Note:** Always inspect charging cables for cuts, cracks, or damage before plugging in. Report damaged equipment immediately.

### Charging Safety Procedures
1. **Park in designated** charging area only
2. **Turn off forklift** and remove key completely
3. **Don all required PPE** before handling connections
4. **Connect positive first**, then negative terminal
5. **Ensure adequate ventilation** - hydrogen gas hazard
6. **Complete full charge cycle** - do not interrupt

:::danger
**Hydrogen Gas Warning:** Batteries produce explosive hydrogen gas during charging. Ensure proper ventilation and NO smoking or open flames in charging areas.

## Cold-Weather Procedures

### Pre-Operation Winter Checklist

| ✓ | Task | Why Important |
|---|------|---------------|
| ☐ | **Scrape windshield & mirrors** | Clear visibility required |
| ☐ | **Apply block heater** (diesel units) | Proper engine operation |
| ☐ | **Clear snow from travel lanes** | Safe traction and visibility |
| ☐ | **Check tire condition** | Ice/snow traction |
| ☐ | **Test brake function** | Cold weather affects braking |
| ☐ | **Warm up engine** | 5-minute minimum warm-up |

### Winter Operating Adjustments
- **Reduce speed by 50%** on icy/snowy surfaces
- **Increase following distance** to 5 truck lengths
- **Use tire chains** if available and approved
- **Avoid slopes** greater than 3% grade when icy
- **Report hazardous conditions** immediately

---

## Parking Requirements

### Designated Parking Areas Only
- **Level surfaces** - maximum 3% grade
- **Marked zones** - stay within designated areas
- **Clear of fire exits** - maintain emergency egress
- **Away from traffic** - not blocking travel aisles
- **Protected location** - shelter from weather when possible

### Parking on Inclines (Emergency Only)

When parking on slight ramps, you must:
1. **Shift to neutral** first
2. **Set parking brake** fully engaged
3. **Chock at least one wheel** - uphill side preferred
4. **Lower forks completely** to ground level
5. **Remove key** and report if recurring issue

## Wheel-Chock Checklist

### Proper Chocking Procedure

| ✓ | Item | Specification |
|---|------|---------------|
| ☐ | **Chock positioned** on downhill side | Against tire contact |
| ☐ | **Chock snug** against tire | No gaps or movement |
| ☐ | **Chock properly sized** | Minimum 1/4 wheel height |
| ☐ | **Chock stored** on hook when not in use | Designated storage location |

:::danger
**Never Leave Forks Raised:** Always lower forks completely, even in "secure" areas. Raised forks are a serious hazard to personnel and equipment.

## Fuel System Maintenance

### Propane Tank Safety
- **Close tank valve** before disconnecting
- **Allow 5-minute cooling** before tank changes
- **Wear safety glasses** during fuel operations
- **Use proper lifting** techniques for heavy tanks
- **Check for leaks** at all connections

### Electric Battery Maintenance
- **Check electrolyte levels** weekly
- **Clean terminals** monthly
- **Inspect cables** for damage daily
- **Maintain charging logs** per company policy

## Record-Keeping Requirements

### Daily Operations Log

| Date | Hour Meter | Charger ID | Operator | Defects Found | Supervisor |
|------|------------|------------|----------|---------------|------------|
|      |            |            |          |               |            |

### Documentation Requirements
- **Operator name** and signature
- **Hour meter reading** (if equipped)
- **Charging station ID** number
- **Any defects found** during operation
- **Supervisor approval** for significant issues

## Emergency Procedures

### End-of-Shift Emergencies
- **Mechanical failure:** Tag out immediately, complete incident report
- **Spill during fueling:** Stop operation, contain spill, call maintenance
- **Electrical problems:** Disconnect power, evacuate area, call electrician
- **Fire/smoke:** Evacuate immediately, call 911, sound facility alarm

### Emergency Contact Information
