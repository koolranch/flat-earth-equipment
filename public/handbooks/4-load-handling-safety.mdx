# Module 4: Load Handling & Safety  
_Flat Earth Equipment • Cheyenne, WY_

---

## Purpose & Scope
This module covers advanced load handling techniques, pedestrian safety, hazard recognition, and emergency response. Focus on maintaining safe distances and identifying workplace hazards.

> **29 CFR 1910.178(n)(1)** – "Unauthorized personnel shall not be permitted to ride on powered industrial trucks."

## Pedestrian Safety Requirements

### Minimum Safe Distances
| Situation | Required Distance | Speed Limit |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Walking pedestrians** | 10 feet minimum | 3 mph maximum |
| **Working personnel** | 15 feet minimum | Walking speed |
| **Group of people** | 20 feet minimum | Stop completely |
| **Children/visitors** | 25 feet minimum | Stop completely |

### Horn Requirements
- **Sound horn at every blind corner** - no exceptions
- **Approaching intersections** - always sound horn
- **Backing up** - continuous horn use
- **Near pedestrians** - brief warning blast
- **Emergency situations** - continuous horn

:::warning
**Critical Rule:** Sound your horn at EVERY blind corner, even if mirrors are present. Mirrors do not eliminate the need for audible warnings.
:::

## Hazard Recognition

### Common Workplace Hazards
1. **Liquid spills** - Any size requires immediate action
2. **Damaged pallets** - Protruding nails, broken boards
3. **Overhead obstacles** - Low beams, hanging signs
4. **Floor conditions** - Cracks, uneven surfaces
5. **Poor lighting** - Shadows, burnt-out bulbs
6. **Blocked exits** - Emergency egress routes
7. **Unstable loads** - Shifting cargo, loose packaging
8. **Electrical hazards** - Exposed wires, damaged outlets

### Spill Response Protocol
When you encounter ANY liquid spill:
1. **Stop immediately** - do not drive through
2. **Block the area** - place forklift to prevent access
3. **Identify the substance** - look for labels/markings
4. **Call maintenance** - report location and size
5. **Stay with the spill** - until cleanup crew arrives
6. **Document the incident** - complete hazard report

:::danger
**Never Drive Through Spills:** Even "minor" spills can cause loss of traction and serious accidents. Block the area until properly cleaned.

## Advanced Load Handling

### Load Assessment Checklist
Before handling any load, evaluate:
- **Weight vs. capacity** - check against data plate
- **Load center location** - measure if non-standard
- **Load condition** - damage, shifting, loose items
- **Pallet condition** - broken boards, protruding nails
- **Packaging integrity** - torn wrapping, loose strapping
- **Load height** - clearance requirements

### Special Load Considerations

#### Damaged Pallets
- **Inspect thoroughly** before lifting
- **Look for protruding nails** that could puncture tires
- **Check for broken boards** that could collapse
- **Report severely damaged pallets** to management
- **Use extra caution** when lifting questionable pallets

#### Uneven Loads
- **Lower lift speed** to prevent shifting
- **Use wider turns** to maintain stability
- **Consider using a spotter** for guidance
- **Take alternative routes** to avoid rough surfaces
- **Inspect load frequently** during transport

#### Oversized Loads
- **Check overhead clearances** along entire route
- **Use escort personnel** if visibility blocked
- **Plan route carefully** to avoid tight spaces
- **Move at reduced speed** throughout transport
- **Coordinate with other operators** in the area

## Emergency Response Procedures

### Load Shift or Fall
1. **Sound horn continuously** to warn others
2. **Do not attempt to catch** falling items
3. **Back away safely** if possible
4. **Clear the immediate area** of personnel
5. **Assess for injuries** - call for medical help if needed
6. **Secure the scene** - prevent further incidents
7. **Report immediately** to supervisor

### Forklift Mechanical Failure
1. **Stop immediately** in a safe location
2. **Lower forks completely** to ground level
3. **Set parking brake** and remove key
4. **Tag out of service** with orange tag
5. **Report to maintenance** with detailed description
6. **Do not attempt repairs** - leave for qualified technicians

### Fire Emergency
1. **Shut off engine immediately**
2. **Evacuate the forklift** quickly but safely
3. **Alert others in the area** with horn/voice
4. **Move to designated assembly point**
5. **Call emergency services** if not already notified
6. **Do not re-enter area** until cleared by fire department

## Personal Protective Equipment

### Required PPE by Situation
| Work Environment | Hard Hat | Hi-Vis Vest | Steel Toes | Safety Glasses | Hearing Protection |
|------------------|----------|-------------|------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Indoor warehouse** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Optional | If ≥85 dB |
| **Loading dock** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Outdoor yard** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | If ≥85 dB |
| **Construction site** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

### PPE Inspection Requirements
- **Daily inspection** of all PPE before use
- **Replace damaged items** immediately
- **Clean regularly** per manufacturer instructions
- **Store properly** when not in use
- **Report defects** to supervisor

---

## Communication & Coordination

### Hand Signals
Standard forklift hand signals:
- **Stop:** Raised hand, palm facing operator
- **Lower load:** Point down with index finger
- **Raise load:** Point up with index finger
- **Move forward:** Wave hand toward operator
- **Move back:** Wave hand away from operator
- **Emergency stop:** Both arms raised overhead

### Radio Protocol
When using two-way radios:
1. **Identify yourself** - name and unit number
2. **State your location** - aisle, building, zone
3. **Describe your action** - what you're doing
4. **Request clearance** - wait for confirmation
5. **Acknowledge instructions** - repeat back important details

---

## Environmental Considerations

### Weather Conditions
#### Rain/Wet Conditions
- **Reduce speed by 50%** on wet surfaces
- **Increase following distance** to 5 truck lengths
- **Test brakes frequently** - check for reduced effectiveness
- **Avoid sharp turns** - take wider, slower turns
- **Be extra cautious** on ramps and inclines

#### Ice/Snow Conditions
- **Maximum 2 mph** on icy surfaces
- **Use tire chains** if available and approved
- **Avoid slopes** greater than 3% grade
- **Keep extra distance** from all obstacles
- **Park indoors** when possible

#### High Wind Conditions
- **Reduce lift height** - keep loads as low as possible
- **Avoid outdoor operations** if winds exceed 25 mph
- **Be aware of crosswinds** affecting stability
- **Secure loose materials** before transport

---

## Workplace Safety Culture

### Reporting Near-Misses
Always report situations that could have caused injury:
- **Close calls with pedestrians**
- **Near tip-over incidents**
- **Mechanical problems** caught early
- **Hazardous conditions** discovered
- **Unsafe behaviors** observed

### Continuous Improvement
- **Participate in safety meetings** actively
- **Suggest improvements** to procedures
- **Learn from incidents** - yours and others'
- **Stay current** with training updates
- **Mentor new operators** in safe practices

---

## Hazard Hunt Game Preparation

### Common Test Scenarios
To pass the Hazard Hunt, you must identify:
1. **Liquid spills** on travel surfaces
2. **Damaged pallets** with safety risks
3. **Overhead clearance** issues
4. **Pedestrian safety** violations
5. **PPE compliance** problems
6. **Emergency exit** blockages
7. **Electrical hazards** in work areas
8. **Unstable loads** ready to shift
9. **Poor lighting** conditions
10. **Forklift maintenance** issues

### Scoring Requirements
- **Minimum 10 hazards** must be identified to pass
- **Each missed critical hazard** reduces score
- **False positives** also reduce score
- **Time limit** encourages thorough but efficient inspection

## Training Review Points

### Key Safety Principles
1. **10-foot minimum** distance from pedestrians
2. **Sound horn** at every blind corner
3. **Block spills** - never drive through
4. **Report all hazards** immediately
5. **Maintain PPE** in good condition

### Common Test Questions
- What is the minimum safe distance to a walking pedestrian?
- When should you sound the horn?
- What should you do if you spot a liquid spill?
- True/False: Mirrors eliminate the need for a horn at intersections.
