# Module 3: Operating Procedures & Load Capacity  
_Flat Earth Equipment • Cheyenne, WY_

---

## Purpose & Scope
This module covers safe operating procedures, load capacity calculations, and the stability triangle. Understanding these concepts prevents tip-overs and load drops.

> **29 CFR 1910.178(o)(2)** – "Trucks shall not be driven up to anyone standing in front of a bench or other fixed object."

## Load Capacity & Data Plate

### Understanding the Capacity Plate
Every forklift has a **data plate** (capacity plate) that shows:
- **Maximum load weight** at specified load center
- **Load center distance** (usually 24 inches)
- **Maximum lift height** for rated capacity
- **Forklift model** and serial number

### Standard Load Center
- **24 inches** is the standard load center distance
- Load center is measured from the **face of the forks** to the **center of gravity** of the load
- Capacity **decreases** as load center increases

:::warning
**Capacity Rule:** Never exceed the rated capacity shown on the data plate. This includes the combined weight of load + attachments.

## Load Center Calculations

### How Load Center Affects Capacity

| Load Center | Capacity Reduction |
|-------------|------------------|
| 24 inches | 100% rated capacity |
| 30 inches | ~80% rated capacity |
| 36 inches | ~65% rated capacity |
| 48 inches | ~50% rated capacity |

### Example Calculation
- **Forklift rated capacity:** 5,000 lbs at 24" load center
- **Actual load center:** 30 inches
- **Reduced capacity:** 5,000 × 0.80 = 4,000 lbs maximum

### Measuring Load Center
1. Measure from **face of forks** to **center of the load**
2. For uniform loads: measure to the **middle** of the pallet
3. For uneven loads: estimate the **center of gravity**
4. **Always round up** when estimating

## The Stability Triangle

### Three Points of Contact
The forklift stability triangle is formed by:
1. **Two front wheels** (or axle centerline)
2. **Rear axle pivot point**

### Center of Gravity Rules
- **Empty forklift:** Center of gravity is behind the front axle
- **With load:** Combined center of gravity moves forward
- **Safe operation:** Keep combined CG within the stability triangle
- **Tip-over occurs:** When CG moves outside the triangle

### Factors Affecting Stability
- **Load weight** - heavier loads reduce stability
- **Load height** - higher loads raise center of gravity
- **Load position** - forward loads reduce stability
- **Mast tilt** - forward tilt reduces stability
- **Speed & turns** - create lateral forces
- **Surface conditions** - slopes and uneven surfaces

:::danger
**Tip-Over Prevention:** Never tilt the mast forward with a raised load. This moves the center of gravity outside the stability triangle.
:::

## Safe Operating Procedures

### Before Moving
1. **Check load weight** against capacity plate
2. **Measure load center** if non-standard
3. **Inspect load** for damage or shifting cargo
4. **Clear the area** of pedestrians and obstacles
5. **Plan your route** including turns and stops

### Traveling With Load
- **Forks low:** 4-6 inches above ground
- **Mast tilted back:** Slightly to secure load
- **Speed limit:** Maximum 5 mph in work areas
- **Clear aisles:** Sound horn at blind corners
- **Maintain distance:** 3 truck lengths from other forklifts

### Lifting & Lowering
1. **Square up** to the load completely
2. **Insert forks fully** under the pallet
3. **Lift slightly** and tilt back to secure
4. **Check load stability** before moving
5. **Lower slowly** at destination

## Capacity Plate Information

### Required Data Plate Contents
- **Manufacturer name** and model
- **Serial number** or identification
- **Maximum load capacity** in pounds
- **Load center distance** (standard 24")
- **Maximum lift height** for rated capacity
- **Fuel type** (electric, propane, diesel)

### Reading the Plate
```
EXAMPLE CAPACITY PLATE
─────────────────────────
TOYOTA 8FGCU25
S/N: 12345
MAX CAPACITY: 5000 LBS
LOAD CENTER: 24 INCHES
MAX LIFT: 189 INCHES
FUEL: PROPANE
─────────────────────────
```

### Plate Maintenance
- Keep plate **clean and visible**
- Replace if **damaged or illegible**
- Never **alter or remove** the capacity plate
- Report **missing plates** immediately

---

## Attachment Considerations

### When Using Attachments
- **Reduces capacity** - check attachment manual
- **Changes load center** - recalculate capacity
- **Affects visibility** - may require spotter
- **Special training** may be required

### Common Attachments
- **Side shifters:** Reduce capacity by ~5%
- **Fork extensions:** Significantly reduce capacity
- **Clamps:** Reduce capacity and change load center
- **Rotators:** Major capacity reduction

---

## Speed & Travel Limitations

### Maximum Speeds
- **Work areas:** 5 mph maximum
- **Pedestrian areas:** 3 mph maximum
- **Ramps and inclines:** Reduce speed by 50%
- **Corners and intersections:** Walking speed
- **Wet or slippery surfaces:** 2 mph maximum

### Travel Rules
- **Loaded travel:** Forks forward, uphill
- **Empty travel:** Forks forward, downhill  
- **No passengers:** Never carry riders
- **One-way aisles:** Follow directional markings
- **Intersections:** Stop, sound horn, proceed carefully

---

## Load Handling Best Practices

### Picking Up Loads
1. **Approach square** to the pallet
2. **Stop completely** before inserting forks
3. **Insert forks** to 2/3 of pallet depth minimum
4. **Lift 2-3 inches** and check stability
5. **Tilt back slightly** to secure load
6. **Check for damage** before moving

### Setting Down Loads
1. **Position accurately** over placement area
2. **Lower slowly** to avoid jarring
3. **Tilt forward slightly** to release load
4. **Back away** before lowering forks completely
5. **Verify load stability** after placement

### Problem Loads
- **Damaged pallets:** Inspect before lifting
- **Uneven loads:** Use extra caution, consider spotter
- **Oversized loads:** May require escort vehicle
- **Hazardous materials:** Follow special procedures

---

## Emergency Procedures

### Load Starts to Fall
1. **Sound horn continuously** to warn others
2. **Do not try to catch** falling load
3. **Back away quickly** if safe to do so
4. **Clear the area** of personnel
5. **Report incident** immediately

### Tip-Over Response
- **Stay in the operator compartment**
- **Grip steering wheel firmly**
- **Lean away** from direction of fall
- **Do not jump** from the forklift
- **Wait for help** after forklift stops moving

## Quiz Preparation Points

### Key Concepts to Remember
1. **Capacity plate** provides maximum safe load at specified load center
2. **Standard load center** is 24 inches from face of forks
3. **Capacity decreases** as load center increases
4. **Stability triangle** keeps forklift upright
5. **Forward mast tilt** with raised load is dangerous

### Common Test Questions
- What information does a capacity plate provide?
- What is the standard load center distance?
- How does tilting the mast forward affect stability?
- True/False: You should fully insert forks under the pallet before lifting
