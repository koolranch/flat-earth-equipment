        <h2>Do Skid Steers Have Titles?</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike automobiles, skid steers typically do not have traditional vehicle titles. Instead, they are documented through:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Certificate of Origin (COO)</li>
          <li>Bill of Sale</li>
          <li>Equipment Registration (in some states)</li>
          <li>Serial Number Documentation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Documentation Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          When purchasing or selling a skid steer, you should have:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Original Certificate of Origin (for new equipment)</li>
          <li>Bill of Sale with detailed information</li>
          <li>Serial number documentation</li>
          <li>Maintenance records</li>
          <li>Warranty information (if applicable)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>State-by-State Title Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Skid steer registration requirements vary significantly by state. Here's a summary of requirements across major states:
        </p>

        <h3>States That Do NOT Require Titles for Skid Steers</h3>

          <li><strong>California:</strong> No DMV title, but local business permits may be required for commercial use.</li>
          <li><strong>Georgia:</strong> No title required. Bill of Sale serves as proof of ownership.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>How to Verify Ownership Without a Title</h3>
        <p>
          When a title isn't available, use these methods to establish ownership:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Serial Number Verification:</strong> Match the serial number to manufacturer records</li>
          <li><strong>Bill of Sale Chain:</strong> Gather bills of sale from all previous owners if possible</li>
          <li><strong>Lien Search:</strong> Use services like Equipment Watch or IronClad to check for liens</li>
          <li><strong>Manufacturer COO:</strong> Request Certificate of Origin records from the manufacturer</li>
          <li><strong>Insurance Records:</strong> Previous insurance policies can help establish ownership history</li>
          <li><strong>Theft Database Check:</strong> Search the National Equipment Register (NER) to ensure it's not stolen</li>
        </ol>
