      q: "How do I choose the right forklift battery charger?",
      a: "Match your battery voltage exactly (24V/36V/48V/80V), calculate required amperage based on your charging window, and confirm your facility's power input (single-phase 208â€“240V or three-phase 480V/600V). Consider your forklift brand compatibility and battery chemistry type. For detailed guidance, see our complete selection guide."
    },
    {
      q: "What amperage forklift charger do I need?",
      a: "Use this formula for lead-acid batteries: charge time â‰ˆ (battery Ah Ã· charger A) Ã— 1.2. Example: 750Ah battery with a 75A charger takes ~12 hours. For faster charging, choose higher amperage but ensure proper ventilation and electrical capacity."
    },
    {
      q: "What's the difference between 24V, 36V, 48V and 80V forklift chargers?",
      a: "24V chargers are for small pallet jacks and light-duty forklifts. 36V suits medium warehouse forklifts. 48V is most common for industrial applications. 80V is for heavy-duty, high-capacity forklifts. Always match your battery voltage exactly."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I use a single-phase forklift charger instead of three-phase?",
      a: "Yes, if your facility doesn't have 3-phase power, choose a single-phase model (208â€“240V input). Three-phase chargers are more efficient for higher amperage applications but require industrial electrical infrastructure."
    },
    {
      q: "How long does it take to charge a forklift battery?",
      a: "Standard overnight charging takes 8-12 hours with conventional chargers. Fast charging reduces this to 4-6 hours but requires higher amperage chargers and proper battery cooling. Charging time depends on battery capacity and charger output."
    },
    {
      q: "Do forklift chargers work with lithium and lead-acid batteries?",
      a: "Most industrial chargers support lead-acid, AGM, and gel batteries. Lithium batteries often require specific charging profiles and BMS communication. Verify compatibility with your battery manufacturer before purchasing."
    },
    {
      q: "What brands of forklifts do these chargers work with?",
      a: "Our chargers are compatible with all major forklift brands including Crown, Toyota, Yale, Hyster, Caterpillar, Nissan, Raymond, and more. Compatibility depends on battery voltage and connector type, not forklift brand."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I troubleshoot a forklift charger that's not working?",
      a: "Check power connections, verify correct voltage settings, inspect fuses/breakers, and ensure proper ventilation. Common issues include loose connections, incorrect voltage selection, or thermal shutoff activation. Contact our technical support for detailed troubleshooting."
    },
    {
      q: "What's the difference between fast charging and overnight charging?",
      a: "Overnight charging (8-12 hours) uses lower amperage and is gentler on batteries, extending battery life. Fast charging (4-6 hours) uses higher amperage for quicker turnaround but may reduce battery lifespan and requires better ventilation."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you offer installation and technical support?",
      a: "Yes, we provide professional installation assistance, technical support, and troubleshooting guidance. Our experts can help with electrical requirements, proper setup, and ongoing maintenance for optimal charger performance."
